# SSH Relay GitHub Release Distribution — Living Implementation Checklist

Date created: 2026-07-14<br>
Last updated: 2026-07-14<br>
Current phase: Milestone 3 / Work Package 2 target-native runtime assembly — exact-head run 29358223742 isolates 2,879 Windows arm64 linker-emitted 16-byte function thunks whose `adrp`/`add`/`br` control flow is byte-identical and whose unreachable fourth `udf` instruction differs, plus 68 derived `/Brepro` identity bytes; exact-head run 29359948742 then proves MSBuild evaluates Release `LinkIncremental` as empty on both native Windows architectures, so the diagnostic fails closed before staging while all four POSIX controls remain reproducible and upload; this disproves the assumed boolean property oracle and does not authorize `/INCREMENTAL:NO`; exact implementation commit `4a66435b7` replaces it with a locally bounded post-build linker-command tracking gate under E-M3-WINDOWS-LINK-COMMAND-TRACKING-LOCAL-001, and the next exact-head run must prove its native record shape and allowlisted switch summary before any producer correction; oldest-baseline, native-trust, cross-family remote, and measured-baseline gates remain open; no bundled-runtime path is enabled<br>

## Mandatory Living-Document Protocol

This checklist is part of the implementation, not a planning artifact that may go stale. Every
agent or engineer working on this project must read it before editing code and update it in the
same change as the work it records.

- At the start of every implementation session, read this document and confirm the current phase,
  open decisions, accepted gaps, and existing evidence.
- Mark the active item with `**In progress — YYYY-MM-DD, owner/agent**` before changing code.
- Keep only one implementation item marked in progress unless independent PRs are deliberately
  running in parallel and each names its owner.
- Do not change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` until the implementation and its required verification are
  complete.
- Every completed item must cite an evidence-ledger ID such as `E-ARTIFACT-001` or a merged PR.
- Record exact commands, runner OS/architecture, commit SHA, result, duration, and artifact link for
  executable evidence. “Tests passed” is not adequate evidence.
- Record what a test does **not** prove. Mock coverage must not be presented as live SSH,
  native-module, release-asset, or platform coverage.
- If implementation changes the design, update both this checklist and the HTML plan in the same PR
  before continuing.
- If a supported tuple lacks required real-environment proof, leave it on a proven legacy path or
  mark it unsupported. Do not check it off based on cross-compilation or emulation alone.
- Never use “100% verified” without naming the exact declared matrix and showing that every required
  cell passed.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes. At checklist creation, the existing edits to
  `ssh-remote-node-resolution.ts` and its test are user-owned issue #8450 work.
- Before every PR handoff, update Current Status, PR/Work-Package Status, Verification Ledger,
  Accepted Gaps, and Next Required Action.

## Status Legend

- `- [ ]` — not complete.
- `- [x]` — complete with linked evidence.
- `**In progress — date, owner**` — actively being implemented; the checkbox remains unchecked.
- `BLOCKED:` — cannot proceed without a named decision, authority, runner, credential, or external
  state. Include the exact unblock condition.
- `ACCEPTED GAP:` — deliberately not proved yet. Include scope, fallback behavior, owner, and
  promotion condition.

## Current Status

- Implementation status: Work Package 0 is committed at `c4259d94f` on current `main`, with refreshed
  focused, static, full-lint, live #8450 SSH/PTY, and GitHub Actions proof (E-M0-UNIT-002,
  E-M0-STATIC-002, E-M0-LIVE-002, E-M0-CI-001). Draft PR
  [#8724](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8724) is open and CI-green at implementation head
  `94e58d83e`.
- Completed package: Work Package 1's disconnected manifest, content-identity, signature,
  release-asset, and conservative selector contracts are locally and CI-green under E-M2-RED-001,
  E-M2-CONTRACT-001, and E-M2-CI-001. They remain isolated in stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728) at implementation commit `b9d80a4cb`; no
  deploy/resolver call site is connected and no tuple is enabled.
- Active package: Work Package 2 target-native runtime assembly, archive inspection, executable
  smoke, SBOM, and provenance only. The Windows x64/arm64 artifact candidate and portability
  corrections are implemented through `b6903b220`, with bounded smoke diagnostics in `3aab5aff8`,
  explicit PTY smoke settlement in `ddf28eb8d`, and bounded active-resource diagnostics in
  `6bba90020`, in stacked draft PR
  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741). Exact-head run
  [29341643555](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29341643555) proves the bundled Node,
  patched PTY input/resize/exit, and watcher lifecycle complete on x64 in 3,357.413 ms with
  56,905,728-byte RSS and arm64 in 6,593.663 ms with 54,505,472-byte RSS, but each child retains a
  Windows handle until the parent kills it at its 45-second bound. Exact-head run
  [29343816558](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29343816558) now classifies the resource
  on both native architectures: after all public PTY cleanup and a two-second observation window,
  one `MessagePort` remains alongside only the expected parent stdio `PipeWrap` resources
  (E-M3-WINDOWS-RESOURCE-DIAGNOSTIC-CI-RED-001). The active slice is an exact-source, fail-closed
  correction applied only to the copied node-pty Windows JavaScript inside runtime artifact
  staging; the repository-wide node-pty patch and legacy/default desktop path must remain unchanged.
  That local contract is green at `c04b4f630` under E-M3-WINDOWS-CONPTY-WORKER-LOCAL-001. Exact-head
  run [29345126283](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29345126283) then passed all six
  native jobs; both Windows architectures shed the `MessagePort` within the two-second observation
  window, exited normally, and uploaded unpublished evidence (E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-001). This package
  may produce test artifacts but must not publish, resolve, transfer, install, launch, or enable
  them.
- Active evidence gate: the immutable Node v24.18.0 contract, pinned release key, bounded verifier,
  and artifact-only CLI are locally green under E-M3-NODE-RED-001 and E-M3-NODE-PROVENANCE-001.
  E-M3-RUNTIME-LOCAL-001 additionally proves one unpublished Linux arm64 glibc assembly, exact-tree
  archive inspection, deterministic repack, bundled Node 24.18.0 execution, real patched PTY, and
  watcher events. E-M3-STATIC-001 records the current focused, type, lint, format, line-budget, and
  diff gates. The first exact-head native run exposed a macOS `/var` versus `/private/var` watcher
  oracle mismatch under E-M3-CI-RED-001. The corrected exact-head run passed target-native build,
  archive/tree verification, bundled Node, patched PTY, and watcher smoke for Linux x64/arm64 and
  macOS x64/arm64 under E-M3-CI-001. A bounded comparator now rejects incomplete outputs and any
  runtime-tree, archive, identity, SPDX, provenance, type, mode, size, or digest drift after two
  independently verified clean builds; its exact implementation-commit contract and static gates
  are locally green under E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-LOCAL-001. Exact-head run
  [29347236627](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29347236627) passed both Linux cells,
  exposed macOS x64/arm64 runtime identity drift, and failed Windows x64/arm64 while collecting the
  new comparator suite under E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-CI-RED-001.
  E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-DIAGNOSTIC-LOCAL-001 removes the comparator shebang, checks both new files
  with `node --check` on POSIX and Windows, and reports runtime-tree drift before derived metadata
  drift. E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-DIAGNOSTIC-CI-RED-001 proves those diagnostics on all six native
  runners: Linux x64/arm64 remain equal, both macOS builds first differ at `pty.node`, and both
  Windows builds first differ at `conpty_console_list.node`. The bounded correction in
  `a09b02ec4` makes macOS retain a reproducible loadable UUID, applies `/Brepro` only to copied
  Windows artifact source, and requires exclusive caller-owned work paths; `3e433b343` makes the CI
  path canonical across runs. E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-LINKER-CI-RED-001 proves both Linux and macOS
  architectures now build, verify, smoke, compare exactly, and upload, but both Windows jobs fail
  closed in contract collection because `ssh-relay-runtime-build.test.mjs` imports a builder with an
  unused Unix shebang. E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-BUILDER-PARSER-LOCAL-001 proves the bounded correction at
  exact commit `f864d3fa6`. Exact-head run 29351557922 then parses and builds on all six native
  runners: Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64 compare exactly and upload, while
  Windows arm64 fully builds, verifies, and smokes both outputs but fails closed before upload when
  `conpty_console_list.node` differs (E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-WINDOWS-ARM64-CI-RED-001). Documentation-
  only exact-head repeat run 29352510414 reproduces the same isolated arm64 drift while all five
  controls compare and upload under E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-WINDOWS-ARM64-REPEAT-CI-RED-001. Native
  Windows arm64 equality remains mandatory; oldest-baseline, native-trust, SSH, and musl cells
  remain open. E-M3-WINDOWS-PE-DIAGNOSTIC-LOCAL-001 proves the bounded diagnostic and fail-closed
  workflow ordering locally at exact implementation commit `39ee3451b`; both native Windows cells
  remained required before interpreting or correcting the producer. Exact-head run 29353432240
  keeps x64 and all POSIX controls green, then reports the real arm64 PE hashes/layout/ranges and
  fails without upload under E-M3-WINDOWS-PE-DIAGNOSTIC-CI-RED-001. Because the 128 detailed-range
  cap is exhausted by `.text`, the active diagnostic-only correction adds raw-section labels and a
  bounded summary across all 2,887 ranges before any producer change. Exact-head run 29357355064
  keeps all five controls reproducible and proves both generated x64 option blocks, but the native
  arm64 build fails closed at the new Release-condition verifier before runtime staging under
  E-M3-WINDOWS-MSBUILD-PLATFORM-CASE-CI-RED-001. The runner exposes `Platform=arm64`; the active
  correction accepts only a case-insensitive exact match for the expected architecture and retains
  every option/cardinality check. Exact-head run 29358223742 proves that correction on the real
  arm64 runner, preserves five exact controls, and reaches paired disassembly under
  E-M3-WINDOWS-ARM64-THUNK-DISASSEMBLY-CI-RED-001. The arm64 outputs have 2,879 linker-emitted
  16-byte function thunks whose three control-flow instructions match and whose unreachable fourth
  `udf` instruction differs, plus 68 derived identity bytes. Strict comparison and rejected-output
  no-upload remain intact. The active diagnostic must prove the generated incremental-link state
  before any producer change. No comparator, publication, or production behavior changes.
- Windows input correction: E-M3-WINDOWS-INPUT-GAP-001 proved the official Windows ZIP lacks headers
  and `node.lib`. Both artifacts now require the exact signed headers archive and tuple import
  library as explicit inputs. The schema, signed-checksum verifier, bounded ZIP/header extraction,
  and import-library staging are locally green under E-M3-WINDOWS-INPUT-001; native Windows build
  proof remains active and no implicit `node-gyp` download is allowed.
- Windows PTY-closure correction: E-M3-WINDOWS-CONPTY-GAP-001 proved the candidate omitted the
  `conpty.dll` and `OpenConsole.exe` files required by Orca's production `useConptyDll: true` path
  and therefore exercised a weaker system-ConPTY smoke. E-M3-WINDOWS-LOCAL-002 proves the corrected
  local tree-closure and smoke configuration contracts. E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-001 proves the corrected
  native x64/arm64 closure executes and settles; oldest-baseline and native-trust cells remain open.
- Windows native progression: E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-002 captured and corrected NTFS fixture modes,
  Windows shebang parsing, authenticated-key checkout bytes, and POSIX-only mode assertions. At the
  corrected exact head, E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-003 proves 20 passing and one intentionally skipped test
  on each native architecture, exact input download, and a common fail-closed Git-for-Windows
  `gpgv` drive-letter keyring incompatibility. E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-004 proves that correction with
  21 passing and one intentionally skipped test, signed input acceptance, native compilation, and
  runtime/ZIP assembly on each architecture; both 45-second bundled smoke commands then time out
  without propagating their already bounded child stderr. E-M3-WINDOWS-SMOKE-SETTLEMENT-CI-RED-001
  and E-M3-WINDOWS-SMOKE-SETTLEMENT-CI-RED-002 then proved functional PTY/watcher smoke still did not
  settle after public listener and terminal cleanup. E-M3-WINDOWS-RESOURCE-DIAGNOSTIC-CI-RED-001
  identifies the persistent native resource as one `MessagePort` on both x64 and arm64 after a
  two-second drain window. E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-001 proves the artifact-only correction removes that
  resource before normal exit on both architectures and retains the uploaded bytes. No oldest-
  baseline, native-trust, SSH, reproducibility, or enabled-tuple claim is made.
- Production behavior: unchanged; Orca embeds relay JavaScript and installs `node-pty` plus
  `@parcel/watcher` with remote npm.
- New runtime assets published: none.
- Bundled runtime enabled: no.
- Declared supported bundled tuples: none until the required target-native and two-layer live
  evidence cells are complete.
- Validation orchestration: GitHub Actions is the primary runner and evidence surface under
  E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001; exact native labels are recorded, while representative cross-family
  remote targets remain open.
- Rollout control: the Beta-tagged option lives on SSH target add/edit surfaces and is persisted per
  target through existing target configuration. It is off by default for existing, new, imported,
  missing, unknown, and malformed configurations, all of which resolve to legacy. Only an explicit
  per-target opt-in selects bundled-preferred behavior, and implementing the setting does not
  authorize default-on rollout or legacy removal (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001).
- Legacy fallback removal: not authorized.
- Next required action: replace the empty-property oracle with a bounded parser for the actual
  post-build MSBuild linker-command tracking record, then rerun all six target-native cells. Require
  both Windows clean builds to report the same allowlisted linker-switch summary before considering
  one copied-artifact producer correction. Preserve strict comparison, no rejected upload, the
  repository-wide node-pty patch, legacy/default path, and every other release gate.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

- [ ] The bundled primary path never requires outbound HTTP, npm, a compiler, Python, or a system
      Node installation on the SSH host.
- [ ] The desktop downloads the runtime, verifies it locally, and transfers it through the existing
      authenticated SSH connection.
- [ ] SSH authentication/connection and relay RPC transport remain unchanged; bootstrap artifact
      transfer is a separately designed, measured, and gated subsystem.
- [ ] Every desktop build embeds the exact signed manifest needed to resolve a remote tuple to a
      content identity while the desktop is offline.
- [ ] Relay artifacts are built and signed before desktop packaging; app builds and GitHub Release
      uploads consume the exact same immutable bytes.
- [ ] No downloaded byte is extracted, transferred, or executed until manifest authenticity,
      expected tuple, size bounds, and archive SHA-256 are verified at the appropriate boundary.
- [ ] A completed remote install is immutable and content-addressed. A running old relay is never
      mutated in place.
- [ ] Bundled and legacy installs use distinct identities, locks, partial directories, sentinels,
      and launch generations.
- [ ] Fallback cannot start until all bundled download, extraction, upload, verification, and launch
      work is aborted, awaited, and unable to mutate state.
- [ ] Signature, archive hash/safety, extracted-tree, or native-signature failure fails closed in
      `auto`: rejected bytes never execute and automatic legacy fallback never starts.
- [ ] Detected local or remote cache corruption is quarantined and may recover only from freshly
      verified bundled bytes; failed/unavailable recovery fails closed without automatic legacy.
- [ ] Local signed-manifest/archive/tree verification plus authenticated SSH transfer into exclusive
      staging is the pre-execution integrity boundary; bundled Node then hashes the entire staged
      tree before any completion sentinel is written.
- [ ] Remote install proof establishes initial transfer/finalization correctness. Warm launch trusts
      Orca's completed-directory immutability assumption; the sentinel is not ongoing proof against
      later mutation or a hostile authenticated account that can replace runtime and sentinel.
- [ ] Platform support is never inferred from an artifact existing. Each enabled tuple requires a
      real-environment runtime proof.
- [ ] Unknown or conflicting platform/libc evidence deterministically selects proven legacy
      behavior; it never guesses an artifact.
- [ ] Runtime transfer has explicit memory, file-count, concurrency, cancellation, and time budgets.
- [ ] Bundled mode depends only on the explicitly declared POSIX or Windows bootstrap primitives; it
      never silently requires remote Node, Python, tar, `sha256sum`, or `shasum`.
- [ ] Every Node/CVE/runtime/key refresh produces a new desktop tag/build and embedded signed
      manifest. Old clients remain frozen to their embedded manifest and accepted keys.
- [ ] Current PTY, watcher, Git, filesystem, streaming, agent-hook, preflight, reconnect, and GC
      contracts remain intact.
- [ ] macOS, Linux, and Windows behavior remains behind runtime checks and uses platform-native
      paths and commands.
- [ ] No implementation file adds a max-lines disable or vague `helpers`/`utils` module name.

## Milestone 0 — Preserve and Prove the Legacy Safety Net

Goal: land the narrow #8450 correction independently because automatic fallback depends on a
coherent Node/npm resolver.

Work Package 0 implementation evidence was completed on 2026-07-14 by the Codex implementation
owner. No relay artifact-distribution behavior is included.

- [x] Confirm the #8450 implementation selects Node and npm from the same bin directory on POSIX.
      (E-M0-UNIT-001, E-M0-UNIT-002, E-M0-LIVE-002)
- [x] Confirm Windows selects `node.exe` and `npm.cmd` from one toolchain directory.
      (E-M0-UNIT-001; mocked Windows command construction, not live Windows)
- [x] Reject an incomplete system Node and continue to the usable NVM candidate.
      (E-M0-UNIT-001, E-M0-UNIT-002, E-M0-LIVE-002)
- [x] Preserve minimum supported Node-version enforcement. (E-M0-UNIT-001)
- [x] Preserve login-shell, known-path, version-manager, noisy-startup, cancellation, and
      `MaxSessions=1` behaviors. (E-M0-UNIT-001; live `MaxSessions=1` remains outside this WP0 proof)
- [x] Add the exact Ubuntu/system-Node-without-npm/NVM-below-`.bashrc`-guard regression fixture.
      (E-M0-UNIT-001, E-M0-LIVE-001)
- [x] Add negative tests for Node present/npm missing, npm present/Node too old, mismatched bin
      directories, and an unusable npm shim. (E-M0-UNIT-001)
- [x] Run focused resolver and deploy tests and record evidence. (E-M0-UNIT-001, E-M0-UNIT-002)
- [x] Run a live SSH reproduction matching issue #8450 and record the selected paths and successful
      relay/PTY launch without recording usernames or home paths in committed evidence.
      (E-M0-LIVE-001, E-M0-LIVE-002)
- [x] Keep this fix in a separate PR or commit from GitHub Release distribution. The reviewed plan
      is commit `2b67de870`; WP0 code is the separate commit `c4259d94f` in draft PR #8724.
      (E-M0-PR-001)
- [x] Document which tuples have a live passing legacy E2E. Fallback is only a support claim for
      those tuples. (E-M0-LIVE-001)

| Legacy remote tuple                                                               | Client           | Transport                                    | Evidence                     | Scope limit                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu 24.04 arm64, glibc, system Node 18 without npm, guarded NVM Node 22/npm 10 | macOS 26.2 arm64 | Built-in SSH2 connection + SFTP relay upload | E-M0-LIVE-001, E-M0-LIVE-002 | Does not prove x64, system SSH, Windows, musl, or `MaxSessions=1` |

Completion evidence required: focused red/green tests, live #8450 SSH run, typecheck, lint, and PR
link.

## Milestone 1 — Close Blocking Product and Support Decisions

No production implementation begins until every blocking item has an owner and decision record.

### Supported runtime baselines

- [x] Define the oldest supported glibc version as 2.28 for initial Linux x64/arm64 candidates.
      (E-M1-BASELINE-001)
- [x] Define the oldest supported libstdc++/C++ ABI level as libstdc++ 6.0.25 with
      `GLIBCXX_3.4.25`. (E-M1-BASELINE-001)
- [x] Define the minimum supported Linux kernel as 4.18. (E-M1-BASELINE-001)
- [x] Define no enabled musl baseline initially. Alpine/musl remains a selector and legacy-path test
      family until Orca produces and proves its own target-native Node/runtime build; no unofficial
      Node binary is accepted. (E-M1-BASELINE-001, E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] Define macOS 13.5 as the minimum for both x64 and arm64 candidates. (E-M1-BASELINE-001)
- [x] Define the initial Windows candidates as Windows 10 22H2 build 19045 or Server 2022 build
      20348 for x64, and Windows 11 24H2 build 26100 for arm64, with OpenSSH for Windows 8.1p1,
      Windows PowerShell 5.1, and .NET Framework 4.8 as minimum bootstrap primitives.
      (E-M1-BASELINE-001)
- [x] Treat a Rosetta-translated shell as x64 process architecture, but keep it on legacy until an
      x64 artifact passes a live Rosetta SSH cell. A native arm64 shell selects arm64; detection
      never forces a native-architecture artifact across a translated process boundary.
      (E-M1-BASELINE-001)
- [x] Document current legacy platform families separately from bundled candidates and distinguish a
      code-declared family from a live-evidenced fallback claim. (E-M1-LEGACY-INVENTORY-001)

Decision owner: Codex implementation owner for #8450. Decision authority: conservative
implementation boundary under the user-approved legacy-default Beta rollout. These are minimum
eligibility constraints, not support claims: every candidate remains disabled until its two-layer
live evidence cells pass.

The initial candidate families are Linux glibc x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64/arm64.
Linux musl, WSL, Rosetta-translated macOS, and any unlisted OS/architecture remain legacy-only.
Version parsing is exact and fail-conservative; an unknown, missing, older, or conflicting baseline
probe selects legacy rather than guessing a compatible artifact.

| Remote family        | Current legacy path                                                                 | Proposed bundled candidate                           | Live fallback evidence in this project |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Linux x64 glibc      | Declared `linux-x64`; coherent remote Node/npm plus remote native npm install       | `linux-x64-glibc`                                    | None yet                               |
| Linux arm64 glibc    | Declared `linux-arm64`; coherent remote Node/npm plus remote native npm install     | `linux-arm64-glibc`                                  | E-M0-LIVE-002 (Ubuntu 24.04 arm64)     |
| Linux x64/arm64 musl | Shares current Linux platform key; compatibility depends on legacy npm/native build | None initially; selector returns legacy              | None                                   |
| macOS x64            | Declared `darwin-x64`; coherent remote Node/npm plus remote native npm install      | `darwin-x64`                                         | None                                   |
| macOS arm64          | Declared `darwin-arm64`; coherent remote Node/npm plus remote native npm install    | `darwin-arm64`                                       | None                                   |
| Windows x64          | Declared `win32-x64`; coherent `node.exe`/`npm.cmd` plus remote native install      | `win32-x64`                                          | None                                   |
| Windows arm64        | Declared `win32-arm64`; coherent `node.exe`/`npm.cmd` plus remote native install    | `win32-arm64`                                        | None                                   |
| WSL/Rosetta/other    | No separate current platform identity; behavior follows detected process family     | No candidate until a separately identified live cell | None                                   |

“Declared” above means the current source accepts the platform and has deterministic unit coverage;
it is not a claim that this project has a passing live SSH fallback cell. Automatic legacy fallback
for a bundled tuple is permitted only where the last column has current evidence for the relevant
family/transport conditions.

### Validation runner and network topology

Decision owner: Codex implementation owner for #8450. Decision authority: worktree owner direction
on 2026-07-14. GitHub Actions is the primary orchestration and durable evidence surface because it
can couple target-native build jobs, packaged-client jobs, logs, metrics, and immutable artifacts to
the exact commit under test without introducing a second release-control plane.

- [x] Use GitHub Actions for the PR, nightly, release, and promotion evidence workflows.
      (E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001)
- [x] Permit a GitHub-hosted runner to fill a required evidence cell only when it provides real
      hardware or native virtualization for the declared OS/architecture and the job records the
      runner label, image/version, architecture, and native-versus-emulated status.
      (E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001)
- [x] Require a real OpenSSH daemon, the full-size packaged runtime, and the production built-in
      SSH/SFTP or system-SSH path named by the cell. A mock server, reduced fixture, cross-build,
      QEMU-only run, or artifact existence cannot fill a live cell. Same-host or native-container
      targets qualify only when they preserve the declared remote OS/architecture, SSH daemon,
      primitive, egress, and isolation conditions. (E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001)
- [x] For Layer B cross-family cells, have the GitHub Actions job provision or connect to an
      ephemeral native SSH target or an approved self-hosted target pool. The remote need not itself
      be GitHub-hosted, but its image/snapshot identity and teardown result are part of the evidence;
      do not assume networking between unrelated hosted jobs. (E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001)
- [x] Keep any tuple without an available qualifying native runner or reachable representative
      remote disabled and on its proven legacy path. (E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001)
- [x] Inventory the repository's available GitHub-hosted runner labels and record native
      architecture, image/version policy, and unreserved capacity. No approved self-hosted SSH
      target pool currently exists. (E-M1-RUNNER-INVENTORY-001)
- [ ] Name and pin the representative POSIX and Windows remote images/snapshots used for Layer B,
      including their OpenSSH and bootstrap-primitive baselines and network-egress controls.
- [x] Use the explicit native GitHub runner labels below for paired legacy-versus-bundled regression
      measurements in the same job, with local network shaping and at least ten samples per path. If
      three qualifying reruns have over 15% coefficient of variation or disagree on the threshold,
      require an approved dedicated runner; do not weaken the threshold. (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)

BLOCKED for cross-family live evidence, not for contract-only work: the Codex implementation owner
owns repo-local fixture/workflow definitions, but a repository release administrator must approve an
ephemeral cloud credential/environment or a self-hosted target pool before immutable POSIX and
Windows Layer B snapshots can be named as reachable infrastructure. The unblock record must include
provider, snapshot IDs, credential owner, egress policy, teardown SLA, and cost/capacity owner. Safe
default: no Layer B cell and no bundled tuple is enabled; continue schema/selector and local
same-family test work without secrets.

#### Native runner inventory decision

Decision owner: Codex implementation owner for #8450. Image authority: GitHub-hosted runner image
catalog; repository workflow inventory at this branch. Pin explicit OS labels in new relay workflows
and record the resolved image version from every job because GitHub refreshes images weekly.
`*-latest` is not permitted for qualifying tuple evidence.

| Client/build architecture | Qualifying label   | Native image family | Capacity/update rule                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux x64                 | `ubuntu-24.04`     | Ubuntu 24.04 x64    | GitHub-hosted ephemeral, unreserved/queue-dependent; weekly image, log exact version |
| Linux arm64               | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | Ubuntu 24.04 arm64  | GitHub-hosted ephemeral, unreserved/queue-dependent; weekly image, log exact version |
| macOS x64                 | `macos-15-intel`   | macOS 15 x64        | GitHub-hosted ephemeral, unreserved/queue-dependent; weekly image, log exact version |
| macOS arm64               | `macos-15`         | macOS 15 arm64      | GitHub-hosted ephemeral, unreserved/queue-dependent; weekly image, log exact version |
| Windows x64               | `windows-2022`     | Server 2022 x64     | GitHub-hosted ephemeral, unreserved/queue-dependent; weekly image, log exact version |
| Windows arm64             | `windows-11-arm`   | Windows 11 arm64    | GitHub-hosted ephemeral, unreserved/queue-dependent; weekly image, log exact version |

The repository already uses `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-15`, `windows-2022`, and a
third-party macOS release label. Existing `latest` and third-party labels may remain for their
current workflows but do not qualify a relay tuple unless the relay job pins the explicit label and
records its resolved image. No approved self-hosted SSH target pool, reserved hosted-runner capacity,
or cross-family remote endpoint is inferred from this inventory; those unresolved Layer B cells keep
the affected tuple disabled.

### Remote bootstrap primitives

- [x] Define the exact POSIX baseline as POSIX `sh` with builtin `command`/`printf` plus
      byte-preserving `cat`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `chmod`, `test`, and `nohup`; no Node, Python,
      Perl, tar, base64, checksum tool, or compiler is permitted. (E-M1-BOOTSTRAP-DECISION-001)
- [x] Define the exact Windows baseline as OpenSSH for Windows 8.1p1, Windows PowerShell 5.1, and
      .NET Framework 4.8 with `FileStream`, `FileMode.CreateNew`, 64 KiB binary reads/writes,
      same-volume `Directory.Move`, ACL-preserving filesystem operations, and the existing detached
      relay launch mechanism. (E-M1-BOOTSTRAP-DECISION-001)
- [x] Capability-probe required semantics with a client-generated nonce and byte fixture, without
      Node or Python, once per authenticated SSH connection. Never persist or share the result
      across hosts or reconnect generations. (E-M1-BOOTSTRAP-DECISION-001)
- [x] Treat missing or semantically incorrect bootstrap primitives as compatibility failure,
      eligible for legacy in `auto` only where that exact legacy family has current evidence.
      (E-M1-BOOTSTRAP-DECISION-001)
- [x] Record no BusyBox-only variant as qualified initially. Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 BusyBox 1.36.1 lacks
      the required `nohup` applet and therefore selects legacy; any BusyBox host must pass the full
      semantic probe with external required commands before it can become a candidate.
      (E-M1-BUSYBOX-001)

#### Bootstrap primitive decision

POSIX system SSH and built-in SSH2 both open a dedicated stdin byte stream for each manifest file.
The remote command creates that file with restrictive permissions and `cat > file`; the client sends
exactly the declared size and closes stdin. The initial semantic probe round-trips a binary fixture
containing NUL, CR, LF, high-bit bytes, and no trailing newline through the same path. Per-file
channels are bounded and become sequential under `MaxSessions=1`. Full staged-tree integrity is
still checked later by transferred bundled Node, not by trusting `cat` or a remote checksum command.

Windows transfer sends raw bytes to a purpose-built PowerShell script that reads
`Console.OpenStandardInput()` into a 64 KiB buffer and writes with `FileStream`. A `CreateNew` lock
file containing an unguessable client token establishes exclusive staging ownership before the
directory is created; every later command verifies that token. The reader rejects early EOF and one
extra byte beyond the declared safe-integer size. It never materializes the file as a string,
JSON/base64 value, or whole-file buffer. Publish uses same-volume rename only after bundled-Node
tree verification and native probes. Probe artifacts and locks are removed on success, failure, or
cancellation; cleanup settlement is part of the timeout oracle.

### Node runtime ownership

- [x] Pin the first runtime contract to official Node v24.18.0 LTS (Krypton). Stay on Node 24 LTS
      until a separately reviewed major upgrade; never silently float a desktop build to a newer
      patch. (E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] Use unchanged official nodejs.org binaries for Linux glibc x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and
      Windows x64/arm64. Build all relay code and native dependencies in target-native Orca jobs;
      do not substitute cross-built Node executables. (E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] Produce no musl Node binary in the initial release. A later musl candidate requires an
      Orca-owned target-native source build, reproducible provenance, signing, and the same live
      gates; unofficial community binaries are prohibited. (E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] Check Node security/release status at least weekly and at every desktop release cut. Triage a
      published Node/runtime CVE within one business day; ship an applicable critical fix within
      seven calendar days and high-severity fix within fourteen, or disable the affected bundled
      tuple while legacy remains available. (E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] Require every Node patch, CVE remediation, native-code change, dependency change, manifest-key
      change, or accepted-key change to create a new runtime content ID and a new desktop tag/build
      with a newly embedded signed manifest. Old clients remain pinned. (E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] Verify the detached Node `SHASUMS256.txt.sig` against a build-input-pinned Node release
      keyring before extraction, record the signer fingerprint and source archive digest in
      provenance, and preserve official executable bytes/signatures. Orca-built native executables
      and libraries still require the target-native signing policy decided below.
      (E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001)
- [x] For Windows native-module builds, authenticate the exact-version `headers.tar.gz` and
      architecture-specific `win-*/node.lib` through that same signed checksum document in addition
      to the tuple ZIP. The official Windows ZIP does not contain either build input; implicit
      `node-gyp` downloads are prohibited. (E-M3-WINDOWS-INPUT-GAP-001)

### Trust and signing

- [x] Use Ed25519 detached signatures through the existing direct `tweetnacl@1.0.3` dependency;
      reject non-64-byte signatures, non-32-byte public keys, unknown algorithms, and unknown keys.
      (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Canonicalize only a fully validated unsigned manifest projection: fixed schema field order,
      tuples sorted by canonical tuple ID, files sorted by portable relative path, safe integers,
      portable ASCII identity/path fields, no optional `undefined`, and UTF-8 `JSON.stringify`
      bytes with no whitespace or trailing newline. Signatures are outside the signed projection.
      (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Generate Ed25519 keys offline, store only the base64-encoded 32-byte seed in a tag-restricted
      `relay-runtime-manifest-signing` GitHub Environment with required reviewers, expose it only to
      the fail-closed aggregate job, pin every action by commit SHA, grant no write permission except
      the separate draft-release upload job, and rely on environment deployment logs for audit.
      (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Define key ID as `sha256:<lowercase hex SHA-256 of the 32-byte Ed25519 public key>`. Embed the
      accepted key set in the desktop. Rotation dual-signs at least two consecutive desktop releases
      and 30 days; old-key removal/revocation and emergency replacement ship only in a new desktop
      build. Old clients and manifests remain pinned with no freshness lookup.
      (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Require embedded manifest tag/channel/version to equal the compiled desktop identity and use
      only that exact release URL. A newer desktop never accepts an older manifest. A user-initiated
      desktop downgrade may use its own embedded older manifest/cache namespace but cannot rewrite a
      newer content-addressed install. (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Use GitHub artifact attestations/keyless OIDC provenance as a supplement, never as a replacement
      for the offline-verifiable embedded Ed25519 manifest signature. (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Preserve valid official Node signatures. Sign every Orca-built macOS executable, `.node`,
      dylib, and `spawn-helper` with the existing Developer ID Application identity before final
      hashes; verify strict codesign and notarized containing-app provenance on a native runner.
      (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Preserve valid upstream Authenticode signatures and send every unsigned Orca-built Windows
      `.exe`, `.dll`, and `.node` through the existing SignPath inner-binary flow before final hashes;
      verify `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` and signer policy on returned bytes.
      (E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001)
- [x] Define target-native trust environments: clean macOS 13.5 x64/arm64 snapshots with quarantine
      plus Gatekeeper/codesign assessment; Windows Server 2022 x64 and Windows 11 24H2 arm64
      snapshots with current Microsoft Defender signatures; and a disposable Windows 11 24H2 x64
      VM with the release WDAC policy in audit then enforced mode. Record snapshot/policy/signature
      IDs in every run; third-party EDR observations may supplement but not replace these gates.
      (E-M1-ENDPOINT-DECISION-001)

#### Manifest-key operational gate

Decision owner: Codex implementation owner for #8450. Operational owners: repository release
administrators for GitHub Environment/reviewer policy, existing Apple credential owners for macOS,
and existing SignPath organization approvers for Windows. No key or secret is created by this
decision. Runtime publication remains blocked until the protected environment, two test keys,
dual-sign/unknown-key/revocation rehearsals, action-SHA allowlist, and access audit are executable.

The signing job receives canonical unsigned bytes and returns only key ID plus signature. The
aggregate job reconstructs and verifies the signed projection before emitting the final manifest.
The desktop repeats the same validation and rejects duplicates before cryptographic verification.
At least one accepted signature is required, every signature entry must be unique, and a malformed
or unknown extra signature fails closed rather than being ignored. Key compromise cannot alter an
old client's embedded manifest or archive hashes; emergency response stops asset publication and
ships a new desktop build with revised accepted keys.

The trust-environment decision does not imply those snapshots exist in an approved pool. Gatekeeper
tests add a quarantine attribute to the downloaded runtime before assessment and execution. Windows
tests update Defender intelligence, scan the unpacked tree, verify every PE signature, run native
PTY/watcher smoke, then repeat under the enforced WDAC policy. Detection, quarantine, or policy
denial is release-blocking and must retain logs without weakening the security product.

### Operational budgets and rollout policy

- [ ] Record current legacy cold-install and warm-connect baselines on representative networks.
- [x] Set the local verified-runtime cache to 2 GiB, with an atomic LRU that never evicts referenced,
      locked, staging, current-manifest, or running content; retain at least current plus previous
      content per used tuple when they fit. (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Reject an archive over 100 MiB compressed, 350 MiB expanded, 5,000 entries, 250 MiB for one
      file, a path over 240 UTF-8 bytes, or aggregate metadata arithmetic outside safe integers.
      (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Set stage ceilings: cache lookup 2 s, connect/DNS availability decision 15 s, download 5 min,
      extraction 2 min, transfer 20 min, remote full-tree verification 3 min, native/smoke probes
      2 min, launch/handshake 30 s, cancellation-and-join 10 s, and total cold bootstrap 30 min.
      (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Limit incremental transfer/extraction memory to 64 MiB on the desktop and 32 MiB on the remote,
      excluding the launched relay's measured steady-state runtime; no single buffer exceeds 1 MiB.
      (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Limit SFTP to four in-flight files and four bootstrap channels by default, reduce to one after
      the existing `MaxSessions=1` capability result, and never exceed eight open file handles in
      either process. (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Require warm-connect p95 to be no more than 100 ms or 10% slower than paired legacy, whichever
      allowance is larger. Cold p95 must not exceed the smaller of the 30-minute hard cap or 115% of
      the measured bytes/throughput lower bound plus five minutes at 1/10/100 Mbps and 50/100/200 ms
      RTT. Offline/connectivity classification completes within 20 s, and legacy starts within 10 s
      after any eligible failure is classified and bundled work is joined. (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Keep automatic legacy fallback through at least two stable releases and 30 days after any
      separately authorized default-on change. Narrowing fallback or removing legacy requires a
      separate review plus complete matrix, soak, support, and rollback evidence.
      (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)
- [x] Use existing per-SSH-target configuration for rollout control; do not add a rollout backend.
      This closes the control-mechanism decision, not its implementation.
      (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)
- [x] Define offline/missing-asset behavior: use a verified client cache without GitHub or remote
      egress; otherwise classified offline/404/cache-unavailable errors may use proven legacy in
      Beta `auto`. If legacy prerequisites also fail, return both stage codes and actionable retry,
      update, or disable-Beta guidance without hiding the original error. Integrity failures never
      fallback. (E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001)

#### Per-target Beta rollout decision

Decision owner: Codex implementation owner for #8450. Decision authority: worktree owner direction
on 2026-07-14. The purpose is to gather real-host evidence without changing behavior for existing
SSH users or making all of a user's hosts depend on one experimental path.

- [x] Keep `legacy` as the persisted and effective default for every existing and newly added SSH
      target. An absent or unknown configuration value must deserialize conservatively to `legacy`.
      (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)
- [x] Expose the bundled-preferred path as an off-by-default option on SSH target add and edit
      surfaces, using the same Beta-tag treatment as existing Beta features and storing the choice
      per target rather than as a global experiment. (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)
- [x] Represent the persisted choice as an extensible mode such as `legacy | bundled-auto`, not a
      boolean. Keep forced `bundled` as a separate engineering/support diagnostic and do not expose
      it as the normal Beta choice. Exact schema naming remains an implementation detail.
      (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)
- [x] Apply a setting change only to the next connection or explicit reconnect. Never hot-swap the
      relay underneath a live PTY, watcher, RPC, reconnect, or reattach generation.
      (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)
- [x] In Beta mode, allow only classified availability/compatibility failures to enter proven
      legacy automatically. Integrity/security failures remain fail-closed; recovery is an explicit
      local action that disables Beta for that target and reconnects through legacy.
      (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)
- [x] Require a separate reviewed rollout decision and completed evidence gates before changing the
      default for any tuple. Shipping the Beta setting does not authorize default-on or legacy
      removal. (E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001)

Decision evidence required: reviewed decision record with owners, dates, rationale, and affected
matrix cells.

## Milestone 2 — Define the Artifact, Manifest, and Identity Contract

Suggested modules are provisional; update this file before choosing different names.

**Work Package 1 complete — 2026-07-14, Codex implementation owner:** implemented the pure manifest schema,
canonical unsigned bytes/signature verification, content identity, and fail-conservative
platform/libc selector with hostile-input tests only. No deploy/resolver call site or bundled tuple is
enabled in this package. Local and exact-head draft PR evidence is recorded under E-M2-RED-001,
E-M2-CONTRACT-001, and E-M2-CI-001.

### Manifest schema

- [x] Add a versioned relay artifact schema in `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-schema.ts`.
      (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Include schema version, exact Orca build tag, relay protocol version, runtime content ID,
      OS, architecture, libc family/version requirements, minimum OS/kernel requirements, Node
      version, dependency versions, archive name, archive size, expanded size, file count, and
      archive SHA-256. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Include every runtime file’s relative path, type, size, SHA-256, and required executable mode.
      (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Include signing key ID, signature algorithm/version, creation timestamp, and provenance/SBOM
      references without making wall-clock time part of runtime identity. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Include target-native code-signing verification attestation, policy/tool identity, and the
      exact attested byte hashes inside the signed manifest. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Reject duplicate tuple entries, duplicate/case-colliding paths, unsafe Windows names,
      unsupported schema versions, missing required files, extra native platform packages, and
      inconsistent aggregate sizes. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Define exact archive naming for stable, RC, and perf builds. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Define exact direct release URL construction. Runtime code must not call the GitHub API or use
      a mutable `latest` URL. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)

### Content identity

- [x] Compute the content identity from canonical full-runtime metadata and file digests, including
      Node, relay entries, native modules, helper executables, and runtime JavaScript.
      (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Prove changing only Node changes the identity. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Prove changing only `node-pty` changes the identity. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Prove changing only `@parcel/watcher` changes the identity. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Prove changing only `relay-watcher.js` changes the identity. (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Prove mode changes for executable files change the identity or are otherwise authenticated.
      (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [x] Prove metadata that should not affect execution does not create nondeterministic identities.
      (E-M2-CONTRACT-001)
- [ ] Update remote directory parsing and GC rules for the new mode-qualified identity without
      breaking legacy directory recognition.

### Archive safety

- [ ] Permit only regular files and explicitly declared directories; reject devices, FIFOs,
      sockets, hard links, and symlinks unless a separately reviewed safe policy is adopted.
- [ ] Reject absolute paths, `..`, drive/UNC paths, path separators inappropriate for the local
      extraction platform, Windows alternate data streams, device names, trailing spaces/dots, and
      case-fold collisions.
- [ ] Enforce compressed size, expanded size, file count, nesting depth, and per-file limits before
      and during extraction.
- [ ] Verify the extracted tree exactly matches the manifest with no missing or extra files.
- [ ] Add deterministic schema, identity, canonicalization, URL, and hostile-archive tests.

Completion evidence required: schema and test files, red/green evidence, canonical test vectors,
and reviewed compatibility contract.

## Milestone 3 — Build Minimal Self-Contained Runtime Archives

**In progress — 2026-07-14, Codex implementation owner:** isolate target-native runtime assembly,
archive inspection, bundled-Node/native-module/PTY/watcher smoke, SBOM, and provenance capabilities
behind purpose-named scripts and CI artifacts. No release publication, desktop resolver, SSH
transfer, install, fallback, rollout setting, or tuple enablement belongs in this package.

**Active sub-gate — 2026-07-14, Codex implementation owner:** exact-head run 29345126283 proves all
six target-native artifact/executable jobs, including normal Windows x64/arm64 settlement and
unpublished upload. E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-LOCAL-001 proves the bounded comparator requires two
independently verified clean outputs and exact type/mode/size/SHA-256 equality for the runtime tree,
archive, identity, SPDX, and provenance before uploading only the first output. Exact-head run
29347236627 first exposed native reproducibility and Windows parser failures. Diagnostic run
29348424235 then passed the parser/contracts on all six runners, kept both Linux tuples equal, and
isolated the first native differences to macOS `pty.node` and Windows `conpty_console_list.node`
under E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-DIAGNOSTIC-CI-RED-001. Artifact consumers, publication, the
repository-wide node-pty patch, and the legacy/default path remain unchanged.

**Active correction — 2026-07-14, Codex implementation owner:** exact-head run 29351557922 proves
the parser and `/Brepro` correction on both Windows architectures, with complete equality on x64.
Windows arm64 builds, verifies, and smokes both complete outputs but first differs at copied-artifact
`conpty_console_list.node`, so the comparator rejects the cell and uploads neither output under
E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-WINDOWS-ARM64-CI-RED-001. The active bounded package adds a test-covered PE
mismatch diagnostic before cleanup: hashes, sizes, coalesced differing byte ranges, and relevant PE
headers only, with bounded reads/output and no failed-binary upload. Exact-head repeat run
29352510414 reproduces the same arm64-only drift while all five controls compare and upload under
E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-WINDOWS-ARM64-REPEAT-CI-RED-001. No comparator weakening, post-build
normalization, producer correction, repository-wide node-pty change, tuple enablement, or production
consumer is authorized without the diagnostic evidence. Exact implementation commit `39ee3451b` is
locally green under E-M3-WINDOWS-PE-DIAGNOSTIC-LOCAL-001. Exact-head run 29353432240 proves the x64
control and real arm64 parser, but its 128 detailed ranges are exhausted by `.text`; the active
diagnostic-only correction adds bounded full-scan section totals/samples before any producer change.
Exact implementation commit `cd7f94136` is locally green under
E-M3-WINDOWS-PE-FULL-SCAN-LOCAL-001. Exact-head run 29354676731 then classifies the complete
arm64 drift under E-M3-WINDOWS-PE-FULL-SCAN-CI-RED-001: 2,879 one-byte `.text` differences at
16-byte intervals plus 68 `/Brepro`-derived metadata bytes, with five controls reproducible and
uploaded and no rejected arm64 upload. Exact implementation commit `6546f54d5` applies the native
toolchain's reproducible compiler and linker settings only to the copied node-pty `binding.gyp` and
is locally green under E-M3-WINDOWS-COMPILER-DETERMINISM-LOCAL-001. Exact-head run 29355973362 then
kept five controls reproducible but reproduced the identical Windows arm64 PE drift under
E-M3-WINDOWS-COMPILER-DETERMINISM-CI-RED-001. Exact implementation commit `0d3a0c9d3` now
fail-closed verifies how those settings reach the generated `conpty_console_list.vcxproj` and adds
bounded paired ARM64 disassembly after a mismatch under E-M3-WINDOWS-MSBUILD-DISASSEMBLY-LOCAL-001;
no second producer correction is justified before the target-native evidence. Exact-head run
29357355064 proves both generated option blocks twice on Windows x64 but fails closed on native
Windows arm64 before staging because the Release group lookup does not accept the runner's lowercase
`arm64` platform spelling (E-M3-WINDOWS-MSBUILD-PLATFORM-CASE-CI-RED-001).

Exact-head run 29358223742 then proves that correction on native Windows arm64 and retains all five
reproducible controls. Both arm64 clean builds log the required compiler/linker options, assemble,
verify, and execute, but strict comparison still rejects `conpty_console_list.node` and uploads no
arm64 artifact. The complete PE scan reports 5,826 differing bytes: 5,758 bytes across 2,879
two-byte `.text` ranges exactly 16 bytes apart plus 68 derived COFF/debug/CodeView bytes. Paired
disassembly proves each 16-byte function thunk has byte-identical `adrp x16`, `add x16`, and
`br x16` instructions; only the unreachable fourth instruction changes from `udf #0x24d` to
`udf #0x16d` (E-M3-WINDOWS-ARM64-THUNK-DISASSEMBLY-CI-RED-001).

Exact-head run 29359948742 proves `MSBuild.exe -getProperty:LinkIncremental` returns an empty value
after each native Windows build. The strict parser rejects that value before staging on x64 and
arm64; all four POSIX controls compare exactly and upload, and neither Windows job uploads. This is
valid negative evidence under E-M3-WINDOWS-LINK-INCREMENTAL-CI-RED-001, but an unset evaluated
property does not classify the actual linker command or authorize a producer change.

**In progress — 2026-07-14, Codex implementation owner:** the disproved property oracle is replaced
locally by a bounded, post-build parser for the target's actual MSBuild linker-command tracking
record under E-M3-WINDOWS-LINK-COMMAND-TRACKING-LOCAL-001. The file read is capped at 256 KiB plus
one rejection byte; logs contain only an allowlisted summary of `/INCREMENTAL`, `/GUARD`, `/DEBUG`,
`/OPT`, `/Brepro`, and `/experimental:deterministic` switches; missing, duplicate, oversized,
malformed, or ambiguous inputs fail before staging. The active gate is the exact-head six-cell
native run. Retain the existing architecture, generated-option, strict comparison, and no-upload
gates. Do not normalize bytes, change the producer, modify repository-wide node-pty, or connect a
production consumer.

Each runtime must contain only the executable closure required by the relay.

- [ ] Replace or extend `config/scripts/build-relay.mjs` without weakening its existing relay and
      watcher content-hash guarantees.
- [x] Add a clearly named runtime assembly script, for example
      `config/scripts/build-ssh-relay-runtime.mjs`.
      (E-M3-RUNTIME-LOCAL-001)
- [x] Pin Node and verify downloaded source/binary checksums and upstream signatures.
      (E-M3-NODE-PROVENANCE-001; real archive execution remains a separate per-tuple gate)
- [x] Extend the immutable Node input contract for Windows to include the signed exact-version
      headers archive and tuple-specific `node.lib`; verify/copy them into an exclusive local build
      root and configure `node-gyp` to fail rather than fetch an unstaged input.
      (E-M3-WINDOWS-INPUT-001; successful target-native offline build remains a per-tuple gate)
- [ ] Build Orca’s patched `node-pty@1.1.0` against the exact bundled Node runtime.
- [ ] Assert Orca-required patched exports/diagnostics exist; do not silently use an upstream
      prebuild that omits the patch.
- [x] For Windows, copy the tuple-architecture `conpty.dll` and `OpenConsole.exe` from the pinned
      node-pty source into `build/Release/conpty`, hash them into the runtime identity as native
      runtime files, and prove PTY spawn/resize/exit with `useConptyDll: true`. Do not substitute a
      system-ConPTY smoke for the production path. (E-M3-WINDOWS-CONPTY-GAP-001,

- [ ] Include exactly one compatible `@parcel/watcher@2.5.6` native optional package.
- [ ] Include relay JavaScript, watcher child, required runtime JavaScript closure, licenses, SBOM,
      provenance, and runtime metadata.
- [ ] Exclude package managers, development dependencies, compilers, sources, caches, build
      directories, and Orca-built debug symbols unless an approved diagnostics requirement needs
      them. Preserve verified official Node executable bytes without stripping or rewriting them,
      even when the upstream binary contains debug metadata.
- [x] Make POSIX `tar.xz` output deterministic for the same tree, epoch, and pinned compression
      toolchain; keep Windows zip determinism as an open per-tuple gate. (E-M3-RUNTIME-LOCAL-001)

- [ ] Sign native code according to the platform decisions in Milestone 1.
- [ ] Verify platform-native signatures/policy on target-native runners after signing and before
      aggregation; attest the exact verified bytes for the signed manifest.
- [x] Run target-native archive inspection and target-runtime smoke before upload for every current
      glibc/macOS/Windows candidate. (E-M3-RUNTIME-LOCAL-001, E-M3-CI-001,

### Per-tuple build and executable proof

Rules:

- [ ] Real hardware or native virtualized execution is required for release promotion. QEMU or
      cross-compilation may add coverage but cannot fill the evidence column alone.
- [ ] A tuple without a trustworthy runtime source or real runner stays disabled.
- [ ] Every archive executes the exact bundled Node, loads both native dependencies, spawns a real
      PTY, performs input/resize/exit, and observes create/modify/rename/delete watcher events.
- [ ] Every build records compiler/toolchain/container image digests and runner architecture.

## Milestone 4 — Make Relay Artifacts Prerequisites of Desktop Builds

- [ ] Add target-native runtime build jobs for every enabled tuple; do not treat a cross-build alone
      as native execution evidence.
- [ ] Add platform-native signing jobs. Signed macOS and Windows runtime bytes must return as
      immutable outputs before final hashes are computed.
- [ ] Add one fail-closed aggregate job that waits for all required native build/signing outputs,
      validates them, computes final hashes, builds the canonical manifest, and signs it.
- [ ] Make Linux, Windows, and macOS desktop build jobs depend on the successful aggregate output.
- [ ] Download the immutable manifest artifact into every desktop build workspace.
- [ ] Embed the exact signed manifest and accepted public keys in the packaged desktop.
- [ ] Prove all desktop variants embed byte-identical manifest contents.
- [ ] Ensure development builds can use a deterministic local unsigned/development manifest without
      weakening official-build verification.
- [ ] Upload the exact prebuilt runtime bytes—not rebuilt equivalents—to the same draft GitHub
      Release as the app.
- [ ] Aggregate platform job outputs without clobbering or duplicating asset names.
- [ ] Extend `config/scripts/verify-release-required-assets.mjs` or add a narrowly named relay gate
      that verifies every enabled asset, manifest, signature, size, and upload state.
- [ ] Download every draft asset back through the authenticated release API, verify byte identity,
      and execute the archive before allowing publication.
- [ ] Confirm stable, RC, and perf tag identities remain exact and cannot cross channels.
- [ ] Confirm a partial or failed relay build leaves the release draft and blocks publication.
- [ ] Confirm artifact upload retries do not change signed bytes or silently replace the manifest.
- [ ] Define bounded retry/timeout behavior for every native build, signing, aggregate, upload, and
      read-back job; exhaustion must block downstream jobs.
- [ ] Make manual signing approval absence, denial, or timeout fail closed rather than allowing an
      unsigned or stale asset through the aggregate.
- [ ] Rehearse signing-service failure and recovery of the same draft without changing already signed
      bytes or accidentally publishing it.

Completion evidence required: release workflow tests, a draft rehearsal, read-back hashes, embedded
manifest extraction from every packaged app, and blocked-publication failure rehearsal.

## Milestone 5 — Implement Desktop Artifact Selection, Download, and Cache

Suggested concrete modules:

- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-selector.ts`
- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-libc-detection.ts`
- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-download.ts`
- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-cache.ts`
- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-extraction.ts`

### Platform and libc selection

- [ ] Reuse current OS/architecture detection without changing supported relay-platform parsing.
- [ ] Add marked, noise-resistant, no-Node libc probes.
- [ ] Prefer `getconf GNU_LIBC_VERSION` when present; parse only output following Orca’s marker.
- [ ] Detect musl through marked `ldd --version` output and known loader paths without treating
      arbitrary startup text as evidence.
- [ ] Validate required libc/libstdc++/kernel/OS versions against manifest constraints.
- [ ] Treat absent, ambiguous, conflicting, or unparseable results as unknown and choose proven
      legacy behavior in `auto` mode.
- [ ] Cover GNU coreutils, BusyBox, Alpine, containers, old glibc, Rosetta, Windows, macOS, startup
      noise, missing commands, localization, cancellation, and `MaxSessions=1`.

### Manifest verification and exact URL resolution

- [ ] Load the embedded manifest for official builds and verify its signature before trusting fields.
- [ ] Verify the manifest-authenticated target-native attestation and exact byte hashes portably; do
      not assume a macOS client can run Authenticode tooling or a Windows client can run `codesign`.
- [ ] Resolve the expected tuple and content ID while fully offline.
- [ ] Construct the exact `/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>` URL without an API lookup.
- [ ] Reject redirects that violate the approved GitHub release-asset origin policy.
- [ ] Ensure authorization, cookies, proxy credentials, and custom headers do not leak across redirect
      origins.
- [ ] Use Electron networking that respects supported system proxy and certificate behavior.

### Download and local cache

- [ ] Store archives and extracted trees under an app-owned cache, keyed by signed content identity.
- [ ] Stream downloads into exclusive temporary files; never buffer a full runtime in memory.
- [ ] Apply download size and time budgets while streaming.
- [ ] Verify archive SHA-256 before extraction.
- [ ] Extract into an exclusive temporary directory with all archive-safety checks from Milestone 2.
- [ ] Verify the exact expanded tree before atomically publishing the cache entry.
- [ ] Coordinate cache ownership across multiple Orca processes and windows.
- [ ] Recover stale download/extraction locks without deleting an active writer.
- [ ] Never select partial files, partial directories, or entries with a failed verification record.
- [ ] Re-verify cached metadata and expected identity before use; define when full file rehashing is
      required.
- [ ] Implement bounded eviction that never removes an in-use entry.
- [ ] Handle read-only cache, permission failures, disk full, quota, inode exhaustion, cancellation,
      crash, corruption, and concurrent download deterministically.
- [ ] Preserve `ORCA_RELAY_PATH` for explicit development/test use with an official-build safety
      boundary.
- [ ] Prefetch only last-known target tuples under an explicit size/network policy; prefetch must not
      block app startup or a normal connection.

### Required offline/cache cases

| Remote runtime    | Local verified cache | Client internet | Expected bundled behavior                                               | Legacy/error behavior                                        | Evidence |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Present, matching | Any                  | Offline         | Launch remote cache without GitHub                                      | None                                                         | —        |
| Missing           | Present              | Offline         | Transfer local cache over SSH                                           | None                                                         | —        |
| Missing           | Missing              | Online          | Download locally, verify, transfer                                      | Fallback only on eligible failure                            | —        |
| Missing           | Missing              | Offline         | Bundled unavailable                                                     | Proven legacy or precise error                               | —        |
| Partial/corrupt   | Present              | Offline         | Quarantine remote entry; replace from verified local cache              | Fail closed if verified reinstall fails; no automatic legacy | —        |
| Missing           | Corrupt              | Online          | Quarantine local entry; redownload and fully verify                     | Fail closed if recovery fails; no automatic legacy           | —        |
| Missing           | Corrupt              | Offline         | Quarantine and reject corrupt cache                                     | Fail closed; no automatic legacy                             | —        |
| Corrupt           | Missing              | Any             | Quarantine remote entry; recover only from newly verified bundled bytes | Fail closed if recovery is unavailable/fails                 | —        |

## Milestone 6 — Add Bounded Runtime Transfer for Every SSH Transport

Current behavior must not be assumed adequate for a much larger runtime:

- POSIX system SSH currently streams a tar archive and requires remote `tar`.
- Windows system SSH currently collects the tree and sends one JSON/base64 package.
- SFTP currently walks files serially and does not preserve executable modes.

### Shared transfer contract

- [ ] Define one transport-neutral source-tree contract based on the verified manifest.
- [ ] Pre-scan and reject local source mutation, symlinks, special files, extra files, and path
      collisions before creating remote files.
- [ ] Stream files with bounded buffers; prohibit whole-tree memory materialization.
- [ ] Pass one AbortSignal through enumeration, channel creation, reads, writes, permission repair,
      and remote cleanup.
- [ ] Close and await every local stream, SSH channel, child process, SFTP session, and cleanup task
      on success, failure, cancellation, and timeout.
- [ ] Track transferred bytes/file counts for progress and bounded diagnostics without logging paths.
- [ ] Restore every executable mode declared by the manifest, including bundled Node and
      `spawn-helper`, before validation.
- [ ] Require exclusive per-file staging so no concurrent writer or launcher can observe a partial
      file as complete.

### POSIX system SSH

- [ ] Capability-probe remote tar with a narrow cache scoped to the SSH host/connection.
- [ ] Keep streaming tar as an optional fast path when proven available and compatible.
- [ ] Add a no-tar bounded file-stream path: frame each manifest file locally, open an authenticated
      SSH exec channel, and stream raw bytes through stdin into its exclusive staged path using only
      the declared POSIX shell/file primitives.
- [ ] Prove the no-tar path does not invoke remote Node, Python, Perl, archive tools, `sha256sum`, or
      `shasum`.
- [ ] Preserve remote path quoting and avoid shell injection for spaces and non-ASCII homes.
- [ ] Verify local and remote tar failures, pipeline failures, and cancellation are all observed and
      joined.
- [ ] Fail with a compatibility classification when a required POSIX primitive is missing or has
      incompatible semantics; do not improvise a text/base64 transfer.

### Windows system SSH

- [ ] Replace whole-tree JSON/base64 buffering with a framed or per-file bounded binary stream.
- [ ] Implement against the declared PowerShell/.NET baseline using binary stdin/file APIs and
      exclusive staged paths; do not depend on implicit console text encodings.
- [ ] Avoid command-line length, PowerShell string, and full-input buffering limits.
- [ ] Handle case-insensitive collisions, reserved names, long paths, endpoint-protection locks, and
      partial writes.
- [ ] Prove binary fidelity without relying on text encoding.
- [ ] Fail with a compatibility classification when the declared PowerShell/.NET primitives are
      missing or incompatible.

### SFTP

- [ ] Add bounded concurrency without exceeding restrictive server session/channel limits.
- [ ] Preserve per-file abortability and close handles deterministically.
- [ ] Restore modes after upload and verify mode-repair failure is fatal before finalization.
- [ ] Compare serial and bounded-concurrency behavior on high-latency SSH.

### Transfer validation

- [ ] Test zero-byte, large, many-small-file, and maximum-allowed trees.
- [ ] Test required-command absence one primitive at a time on POSIX and Windows.
- [ ] Test supported and unsupported BusyBox command variants, including byte fidelity and exit-code
      behavior.
- [ ] Test source mutation and local symlink replacement during upload.
- [ ] Test network interruption at beginning, middle, final file, permission repair, and sentinel
      write.
- [ ] Test local and remote disk full, quota, inode exhaustion, read-only target, noexec target,
      Windows antivirus lock, and SSH channel closure.
- [ ] Measure peak RSS, bytes buffered, open file handles, channels, duration, and cancellation
      settlement against Milestone 1 budgets.
- [ ] Prove cancelled transfer performs no later writes.

## Milestone 7 — Install, Verify, Launch, Reconnect, and Garbage-Collect

Suggested concrete modules:

- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-runtime-transfer.ts`
- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-runtime-validation.ts`
- `src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-bootstrap-mode.ts`

- [ ] Refactor `ssh-relay-deploy.ts` without adding a max-lines disable; split by domain
      responsibility where necessary.
- [ ] Resolve expected bundled content identity before remote install-state probing.
- [ ] Verify embedded manifest signature, tuple, limits, archive SHA-256, and exact extracted tree on
      the client before transfer begins.
- [ ] Use mode-qualified, content-addressed remote directories and locks.
- [ ] Upload into a mode-qualified partial/staging directory that no launcher or GC can treat as
      complete.
- [ ] Treat local verification plus authenticated SSH transfer into exclusive staging as the
      pre-execution integrity boundary; document that a hostile authenticated account is out of scope.
- [ ] Do not require a remote hash utility. Run bundled Node from the transferred staging path as the
      first staged binary execution, verify its exact version, and use it to hash every manifest file.
- [ ] Compare the complete staged-tree sizes and SHA-256 values before any sentinel or publish step.
- [ ] Load `node-pty` and `@parcel/watcher` through bundled Node.
- [ ] Repeat target-native execution/policy probes before finalization; any native-trust failure is an
      integrity/security failure even though transfer may already have occurred.
- [ ] Run a minimal real PTY input/resize/exit smoke and watcher event smoke before finalization.
- [ ] Write structured `.install-complete` contents containing schema, mode, content ID, manifest
      digest, and validation version; do not use an empty sentinel.
- [ ] Assert the ordering: full-tree hash comparison, native loads, PTY/watcher smoke, then completion
      sentinel and atomic publication. No earlier stage may write a success sentinel.
- [ ] Atomically publish the completed install or otherwise prove no observer can see it as complete
      before validation finishes.
- [ ] On warm reconnect, require the expected structured sentinel identity plus required-file
      presence and signed-manifest size metadata before treating the directory as initially validated.
- [ ] Do not full-tree rehash every warm launch. Trust the structured initial-install proof under the
      completed-directory immutability assumption to protect latency; explicitly document that the
      sentinel is not ongoing proof against post-install filesystem mutation.
- [ ] Treat any detected warm-cache absence, size/hash mismatch, unexpected file, or changed sentinel
      as integrity failure: quarantine it, recover only from freshly verified bundled bytes, and fail
      closed without automatic legacy if recovery cannot complete.
- [ ] Launch `relay.js` with bundled Node and an environment that cannot accidentally resolve remote
      user packages ahead of bundled dependencies.
- [ ] Preserve protocol-handshake and version-mismatch behavior.
- [ ] Preserve `MaxSessions=1` sequential fallback for probes.
- [ ] Preserve concurrent install locking, stale-lock recovery, cross-version isolation, reconnect,
      PTY reattach, watcher isolation, and best-effort GC.
- [ ] Ensure GC recognizes bundled, legacy, partial, locked, active, and malformed directories and
      never deletes a live version.
- [ ] Ensure a failed bundled install never mutates a completed legacy install or running relay.
- [ ] Confirm primary-path command capture contains no npm, curl, wget, registry, compiler, Python,
      system-Node, `sha256sum`, or `shasum` invocation.

Completion evidence required: deterministic install/failure tests, built-runtime harness, live SSH
connect/reconnect/upgrade/downgrade, PTY/watcher proof, and command audit.

## Milestone 8 — Implement a Safe, Explicit Fallback State Machine

Modes:

- `auto`: bundled primary; eligible availability/compatibility failures may use proven legacy.
- `bundled`: bundled only; fail with exact stage and recovery guidance.
- `legacy`: current embedded relay plus coherent remote Node/npm behavior.

The public per-target Beta choice maps `bundled-auto` configuration to internal `auto` behavior.
Missing, unknown, or disabled configuration maps to `legacy`; forced `bundled` remains an
engineering/support control.

- [ ] Add the versioned per-target runtime-mode field and prove existing, missing, malformed,
      imported, and newly created target configurations resolve to `legacy` unless explicitly
      opted in.
- [ ] Add the Beta-tagged option to SSH target add and edit surfaces using the existing design-system
      Beta treatment; persist it only for that target.
- [ ] Prove the add-target control is visibly off, the edit-target control reflects only that
      target's persisted mode, and saving or reconnecting one target cannot change another target.
- [ ] Prove an off, absent, unknown, malformed, existing, or imported setting routes directly through
      the current legacy bootstrap without entering bundled manifest, cache, download, transfer, or
      install work.
- [ ] Prove toggling the option does not mutate or restart a live relay and takes effect only on the
      next connection or explicit reconnect.
- [ ] For fail-closed Beta errors, provide an explicit local “disable Beta and reconnect” recovery
      action that updates the target before starting legacy; never disguise it as automatic fallback.
- [ ] Record privacy-safe tuple, transport, stage, duration, outcome, and fallback reason under
      existing telemetry consent without hostname, username, path, command, or target identity.

### State and cancellation

- [ ] Model explicit states for manifest resolution, local-cache lookup, download, extraction,
      transfer, remote verification, launch, bundled cleanup, legacy bootstrap, and connected.
- [ ] Give every state a named timeout budget and child AbortSignal derived from one parent.
- [ ] Replace timeout-only `Promise.race` behavior where underlying deployment can continue after the
      caller fails.
- [ ] On eligible bundled failure, abort, close, and await all bundled work before legacy begins.
- [ ] Invalidate callbacks by generation so late completion cannot write a sentinel, launch a relay,
      report success, or mutate cache/install state.
- [ ] Use separate bundled/legacy identities, locks, partial dirs, completion records, and GC rules.
- [ ] Ensure two simultaneous clients choosing different modes cannot modify one another’s install.
- [ ] Preserve the original bundled failure and fallback outcome in bounded diagnostics.

### Failure classification

- [ ] Classify GitHub unavailable, client offline, asset missing, approved redirect failure, proxy
      failure, local cache unavailable, unsupported tuple, and bundled runtime incompatibility.
- [ ] Classify signature mismatch, archive hash mismatch, unsafe archive, extracted/transferred-tree
      mismatch, bundled-Node corruption, and native-signature failure as integrity/security failures.
- [ ] Permit automatic legacy only for explicitly classified availability/compatibility failures and
      only for remote tuples with current legacy evidence.
- [ ] Make every integrity/security failure fail closed in `auto`; assert no legacy process, lock,
      partial directory, or diagnostic “fallback success” is created.
- [ ] Never execute rejected bytes. Delete/quarantine them according to an explicit policy.
- [ ] If legacy prerequisites are unproved or fail, return an error that includes bundled stage,
      fallback stage, actionable recovery, and no sensitive paths.
- [ ] Forced `bundled` never silently changes mode.
- [ ] Forced `legacy` never performs a GitHub runtime download.

### Race and fallback proof

- [ ] Timeout during download, extraction, SFTP transfer, system-SSH transfer, chmod, hash, PTY
      smoke, watcher smoke, sentinel write, and launch.
- [ ] Cancellation while a sibling connection waits on the bundled lock.
- [ ] Bundled failure while an old bundled relay remains live.
- [ ] Bundled failure while legacy install is complete and live.
- [ ] Legacy failure after bundled cleanup.
- [ ] App shutdown during every state.
- [ ] Assert zero post-fallback bundled writes, processes, channels, locks, and callbacks.

## Milestone 9 — Diagnostics, Progress, Support, and Privacy

- [ ] Define stable stage codes for selection, manifest, cache, download, extraction, transfer,
      permission repair, remote hash, native probe, smoke, launch, fallback, and connected.
- [ ] Define stable fallback reason codes without embedding remote output, usernames, hostnames, IPs,
      repository names, or paths.
- [ ] Preserve exact low-level errors in local diagnostic logs with existing redaction boundaries.
- [ ] Add aggregate duration/byte/count metrics only through existing authorized diagnostics or
      telemetry mechanisms; do not imply authorization for a new backend.
- [ ] Provide progress labels for operations exceeding the style-guide thresholds; avoid flashing
      progress for warm cache hits.
- [ ] Keep connection controls disabled immediately while maintaining stable focus.
- [ ] Document `auto`, `bundled`, and `legacy` support overrides and their intended support use.
- [ ] Add troubleshooting for client offline, remote offline, missing asset, unsupported tuple,
      signature failure, noexec home, disk full, proxy, and fallback failure.
- [ ] Make user-visible wording state facts only after the corresponding stage result exists.
- [ ] Add tests for diagnostic bounds, redaction, stage ordering, duplicate suppression, and
      cancellation/fallback reporting.

## Milestone 10 — Deterministic Test and Fault-Injection Coverage

### Schema, selector, and trust

- [ ] Canonical manifest serialization golden vectors.
- [ ] Valid/invalid signatures, unknown key IDs, rotated keys, revoked keys, wrong tag, rollback, and
      unsupported schema.
- [ ] Valid/tampered/missing target-native trust attestations and attested-byte hash mismatches,
      verified from clients running a different OS than the target tuple.
- [ ] Every OS/architecture/libc selection plus unknown/conflicting/noisy probes.
- [ ] Minimum-version boundaries for libc, libstdc++, kernel, macOS, and Windows.
- [ ] Exact stable/RC/perf URL and channel mapping.

### Cache and download

- [ ] 200 and approved redirects, redirect loop, wrong origin, missing `Location`, 404, 429 with
      retry policy, 5xx, timeout, proxy auth, certificate failure, truncated body, oversized body,
      wrong content length, wrong hash, and deleted asset.
- [ ] Cold, warm, offline, corrupt, partial, concurrent, multi-process, stale-lock, eviction, read-only,
      permission, local disk full, quota, and inode cases.
- [ ] Archive traversal, absolute path, symlink/hardlink/device, Windows name/path, case collision,
      archive bomb, too many files, deep nesting, unexpected file, and source mutation cases.
- [ ] Assert bad manifest signature, archive hash, archive safety, extracted-tree hash, and native
      signature each fail closed in `auto` without entering legacy.

### Install and fallback

- [ ] Full identity change and remote-directory change for every executable component.
- [ ] Lock first acquisition, waiter, concurrent probe, stale recovery, cancellation, and host
      isolation.
- [ ] Partial install is never complete; structured sentinel must match expected mode/content/schema.
- [ ] Transfer corruption is detected before finalization.
- [ ] Missing remote `sha256sum`/`shasum` still succeeds through bundled-Node full-tree hashing.
- [ ] Corrupt one uploaded file after transfer and before verification; prove no sentinel is written
      and no relay launches.
- [ ] Corrupt or prevent execution of the transferred bundled Node; prove verification fails before
      sentinel and does not automatically enter legacy as an integrity failure.
- [ ] Corrupt local and completed remote caches; prove quarantine plus recovery from freshly verified
      bytes, or fail-closed behavior with zero automatic legacy when recovery is unavailable/fails.
- [ ] Mutate a warm remote file/sentinel and prove every detected case fails closed. Separately prove
      an unchanged warm path trusts initial-install proof without a full-tree rehash and meets latency.
- [ ] Instrument stage ordering and prove tree hash → native loads → PTY/watcher smoke → sentinel →
      publish/launch with no alternative success path.
- [ ] Existing legacy and bundled installs never overlap or mutate.
- [ ] All fallback transition and stale-generation cases from Milestone 8.

### Relay behavior

- [ ] Protocol handshake and frame compatibility.
- [ ] PTY spawn, attach, input, resize, signal, exit, reconnect, and error mapping.
- [ ] Filesystem read/write/stat/readdir/search and bulk streaming.
- [ ] Filesystem watch registration, overflow, cancellation, crash isolation, and recovery.
- [ ] Git status/diff/blob/worktree/submodule/ignore and response streaming using Git 2.25-compatible
      commands and existing capability rules.
- [ ] Agent hooks, managed hook installation, remote CLI, preflight, port scan, subprocess, and aborts.
- [ ] Grace-period detach/reattach, two clients, app restart, remote restart, upgrade, downgrade, and
      GC.

## Milestone 11 — Live Platform and Environment Matrix

Use a risk-based two-layer matrix. This does **not** claim every client × remote tuple combination.
Every required cell must contain one or more evidence IDs rather than a bare checkmark or prose.

### Layer A — every enabled remote tuple across both transport families

Each cell’s evidence must cover a native real runner, no Node/npm/compiler, blocked remote egress,
PTY, watcher, every relay RPC family, reconnect/upgrade, and eligible legacy fallback. POSIX system
SSH evidence includes the no-tar path; Windows system SSH is a mandatory distinct path.

| Remote tuple      | Built-in SSH/SFTP evidence ID | System SSH evidence ID | `MaxSessions=1` evidence ID | Baseline/native-policy evidence ID |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| linux-arm64-glibc | —                             | —                      | —                           | —                                  |
| linux-x64-musl    | —                             | —                      | —                           | —                                  |
| linux-arm64-musl  | —                             | —                      | —                           | —                                  |
| darwin-x64        | —                             | —                      | —                           | —                                  |
| darwin-arm64      | —                             | —                      | —                           | —                                  |

| win32-arm64       | —                             | —                      | —                           | —                                  |

### Layer B — every supported client against representative remote families

Each supported client OS/architecture must prove resolver/cache behavior and both transfer families
against representative POSIX and Windows remotes. This layer catches client-specific process,
filesystem, proxy/certificate, executable-bit, quoting, and cache behavior without pretending to be
a full Cartesian product.

| Client        | Resolver/cache evidence ID | Built-in → POSIX evidence ID | Built-in → Windows evidence ID | System SSH → POSIX evidence ID | System SSH → Windows evidence ID |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| macOS x64     | —                          | —                            | —                              | —                              | —                                |

- [ ] Define and record the representative POSIX and Windows remotes used by Layer B.
- [ ] Require Windows remote/system-SSH and `MaxSessions=1` evidence before any Windows remote tuple
      is enabled.
- [ ] Reject promotion if any required cell still contains `—`; do not roll up partial evidence into
      an unsupported “all combinations” claim.

### Required environment variants

- [ ] Exact #8450: system Node without npm plus usable NVM below `.bashrc` non-interactive guard.
- [ ] No Node, npm, Python, make, compiler, registry, curl, or wget.
- [ ] No tar, `sha256sum`, or `shasum`; no-tar transfer and bundled-Node verification still succeed.
- [ ] Remove each required POSIX and Windows bootstrap primitive in turn and verify deterministic
      compatibility classification.
- [ ] Remote egress denied at the network layer and audited for attempted connections.
- [ ] `~/.npmrc` with `ignore-scripts=true`, broken registry, and read-only npm cache.
- [ ] `MaxSessions=1`, noisy startup, slow SSH, packet interruption, proxy jump, and system SSH.
- [ ] Spaces, Unicode, long paths, case collisions, restrictive umask, read-only home, noexec home,
      disk quota, inode exhaustion, and endpoint-protection locks.
- [ ] Supported and unsupported BusyBox/Alpine primitive variants, old supported glibc boundary,
      containerized host, Rosetta, Windows OpenSSH, and enterprise native-code policy.
- [ ] Two Orca clients connecting/installing simultaneously.
- [ ] Existing live PTY during app/relay upgrade and downgrade.
- [ ] Remote reboot, app crash/restart, interrupted first install, stale lock, and GC with a live old
      relay.

## Milestone 12 — Performance and Resource Regression Gates

Baseline measurements must be captured before product behavior changes.

- [ ] Record legacy cold install p50/p95, warm connect p50/p95, transferred bytes, remote CPU/RSS,
      desktop CPU/RSS, process/channel/file counts, and failure timeout on the same machines used for
      comparison.
- [ ] Measure bundled cold download + transfer, local-cache transfer, remote-cache launch, GitHub
      failure-to-fallback, and client-offline behavior.
- [ ] Test at 1, 10, and 100 Mbps with 50, 100, and 200 ms latency and defined loss/jitter.
- [ ] Prove remote-cache warm connect meets the numeric Milestone 1 budget.
- [ ] Prove local-cache transfer and cold download meet the numeric Milestone 1 budgets.
- [ ] Prove SFTP and system-SSH transfer peak memory remain bounded by the numeric budgets.
- [ ] Prove file count does not cause unbounded sequential round trips or channel fanout.
- [ ] Prove cache verification/eviction does not block Electron startup or the renderer main thread.
- [ ] Prove failed bundled attempts do not add an unacceptable delay before eligible legacy fallback.
- [ ] Record before/after results, machine identity, network shaping, commit SHA, command, raw artifact,
      and statistical interpretation.
- [ ] Add demotion thresholds for latency, memory, transfer flakes, cache corruption, and fallback
      delay.

## Milestone 13 — Supply-Chain and Security Completion

- [ ] Write the explicit threat model and trust boundaries.
- [ ] Generate and publish an SBOM per runtime and aggregate release.
- [ ] Record build provenance, source revisions, toolchain/container digests, and native signatures.
- [ ] Verify official Node checksums/signatures before assembly and preserve native trust where
      possible.
- [ ] Verify Orca-built native code signatures on target macOS and Windows policies.
- [ ] Verify target-native attestation generation/read-back, signed-manifest authentication, portable
      client verification, and pre-finalization target policy probes on exact bytes.
- [ ] Exercise manifest key rotation and dual-key migration in a release rehearsal.
- [ ] Exercise compromised/revoked-key response by shipping a new desktop build with newly embedded
      keys/manifest; prove there is no mutable freshness or `latest` lookup.
- [ ] Exercise anti-rollback across stable, RC, perf, desktop upgrade, and desktop downgrade.
- [ ] Add dependency and Node CVE monitoring with a named owner and response SLA.
- [ ] Exercise an emergency runtime refresh through a new desktop tag/build, embedded manifest,
      identity, release, download, remote coexistence, and GC; prove an installed old client remains
      pinned to its original manifest.
- [ ] Review archive parsing, redirect handling, cache permissions, local TOCTOU, remote quoting,
      native loading search paths, and diagnostic redaction.
- [ ] Complete security review before `auto` becomes default for any stable tuple.

## Milestone 14 — Release, Rollout, Rollback, and Fallback Retirement

### Asset-only

- [ ] Publish complete runtime assets and signed manifest without production consumption.
- [ ] Run read-back, direct public URL, archive execution, and packaged-manifest comparison.
- [ ] Accumulate build/release flake and duration evidence.
- [ ] Rehearse native build/signing timeout, bounded retry success/exhaustion, manual approval
      absence/denial, signing failure, aggregate failure, and recovery of an unpublished draft.

### Per-target Beta — legacy remains default

- [ ] Ship the Beta-tagged per-target option in RC and stable builds with every existing and new
      target defaulting to `legacy`.
- [ ] Enable forced `bundled` only for engineering and support diagnostics; normal testers use the
      per-target `bundled-auto` Beta choice.
- [ ] Verify diagnostics and support recovery for every failure class.
- [ ] Run the full enabled tuple matrix and security/performance gates.
- [ ] Exercise forced `legacy` rollback from the same build.
- [ ] Accumulate approved privacy-safe Beta usage, success, classified fallback, integrity failure,
      latency, PTY/watcher, reconnect, and support evidence per exact tuple.

### Future default-on evaluation — separately authorized

- [ ] Obtain a separate reviewed decision before changing any target's default from `legacy`; this
      issue and the Beta implementation do not authorize that change.
- [ ] Consider default `auto` only for tuples whose artifact, live matrix, Beta usage, and support
      evidence are complete.
- [ ] Require three consecutive RC builds with no unexplained fallback, cache-corruption, PTY,
      watcher, reconnect, native-policy, or release failures.
- [ ] Test GitHub outage, client offline, remote offline, missing asset, unsupported tuple, and
      integrity failure from the packaged RC.
- [ ] Prove every integrity/security failure in that RC fails closed without automatic legacy.
- [ ] Confirm non-enabled tuples deterministically retain proven legacy behavior.

### Stable Beta soak

- [ ] Publish the opt-in Beta to stable only after its release-blocking gates pass against exact
      uploaded bytes; stable publication still leaves every target on `legacy` unless opted in.
- [ ] Keep automatic legacy fallback for at least the decided number of stable cycles.
- [ ] Monitor approved privacy-safe success/fallback/error signals and support reports.
- [ ] Define immediate demotion/rollback signals and owner.
- [ ] Exercise rollback without deleting live bundled or legacy remote installs.
- [ ] Do not narrow fallback until every retirement criterion below is satisfied.

### Fallback retirement criteria

- [ ] Every claimed supported tuple has stable real-environment bundled proof.
- [ ] Both layers of the risk-based client/transport/environment matrix are complete with an evidence
      ID in every required cell.
- [ ] Soak duration and release count meet the Milestone 1 policy.
- [ ] No unexplained fallback remains.
- [ ] GitHub outage and offline behavior remain acceptable without hidden remote requirements.
- [ ] Support has a tested downgrade/recovery path for old app versions and old remote installs.
- [ ] A separate reviewed decision explicitly authorizes removing or narrowing remote npm fallback.

### E-PLAN-001 — Initial checklist creation

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: uncommitted working tree
- Runner: documentation-only local worktree
- Remote: not applicable
- Transport/network: not applicable
- Exact command:

  ````

- Result: SUPERSEDED after subsequent review-driven plan expansion; originally PASS for document
  creation only.
- Duration and resource metrics: 1.0 second; `links=1 fences=2 open=349 complete=0`.
- Artifact/log/trace link: this file and the linked HTML plan
- Oracle proved: the living checklist exists and covers implementation, validation, release, and
  rollback work.
- Does not prove: any product behavior, artifact build, SSH runtime, platform, security, release, or
  performance claim.
- Checklist items satisfied: none of the implementation milestones.
- Follow-up: replaced by E-PLAN-002; close Milestone 1 decisions before production implementation.

### E-PLAN-002 — Post-round-3 plan validation

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: uncommitted planning worktree; implementation not started
- Runner: macOS arm64 local documentation validation
- Remote: not applicable
- Transport/network: local file rendering only
- Exact command:

  ````sh
  git diff --check
  node --input-type=module - <<'NODE'
  import fs from 'node:fs'

  console.log({ links: links.length, fences, open, done, htmlIds: ids.length, fragmentLinks: hrefs.length })
  NODE
  ````

- Result: SUPERSEDED after the round-4 tuple-status correction; originally PASS for the working-tree
  artifacts after round-3 findings were resolved.
- Duration and resource metrics: 7.1 seconds; `links=1 fences=2 open=402 complete=0
htmlIds=11 fragmentLinks=9`.
- Artifact/log/trace link: this file, the linked HTML plan, and local screenshots
  `/tmp/relay-plan-desktop-light.png` and `/tmp/relay-plan-mobile-dark.png`.
- Oracle proved: Markdown rendered with balanced fences, valid local links, and no prematurely
  completed implementation boxes; HTML parsed without parse errors, duplicate IDs, or broken
  fragment links; `git diff --check` passed. HTML SHA-256 was
  `375659e4ed3c4ec06b8077cae5badf39761ea5d92267612081195d6a027e073f`; the checklist prefix
  before this ledger was `b599bf0c7ce6ca5ceb6188a153deb3437443f61d8a09069c8dc8dd6f21cdf9ad`.
- Does not prove: any product behavior, artifact build, SSH runtime, platform, security, release, or
  performance claim. Visual mobile emulation must be repeated after the final review because the
  first CLI session relaunched at its default viewport.
- Checklist items satisfied: none of the implementation milestones.
- Follow-up: replaced by E-PLAN-003; complete final visual validation before implementation handoff.

### E-PLAN-003 — Post-round-4 static validation

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: uncommitted planning worktree; implementation not started
- Runner: macOS arm64 local documentation validation
- Remote: not applicable
- Transport/network: local file parsing only
- Exact command: the exact `git diff --check` and inline `marked`/`parse5` command block recorded in
  E-PLAN-002, followed by `shasum -a 256` for the HTML and the checklist prefix before this ledger.
- Result: PASS for current static planning artifacts.
- Duration and resource metrics: under 1 second; `links=1 fences=2 open=402 complete=0 htmlIds=11
fragmentLinks=9`.
- Artifact/log/trace link: this file and the linked HTML plan.
- Oracle proved: Markdown/HTML structure, links, task-state integrity, fragment IDs, whitespace, and
  current artifact identity. HTML SHA-256 is
  `728fa4edcf37e834f064a32308b2901a455402a61016bd7b047b151a75100bf1`; the checklist prefix
  before this ledger is `b599bf0c7ce6ca5ceb6188a153deb3437443f61d8a09069c8dc8dd6f21cdf9ad`.
- Does not prove: any product behavior or final visual responsiveness.
- Checklist items satisfied: none of the implementation milestones.
- Follow-up: obtain an explicit clean independent review, then run final desktop/mobile visual
  validation and implementation handoff.

### E-PLAN-004 — Clean review and final visual validation

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: uncommitted planning worktree; implementation not started
- Runner: macOS arm64, agent-browser Chromium
- Remote: not applicable
- Transport/network: local `file://` rendering
- Exact command: independent subagent round 5 reviewed both files completely and returned `CLEAN`;
  agent-browser opened the HTML at 1440×1000 light mode and 390×844 @3x dark/reduced-motion mode,
  captured screenshots, queried document/table widths and media state, and checked page errors.
- Result: PASS.
- Duration and resource metrics: desktop `documentWidth=1440`, no page overflow, both tables
  `clientWidth=scrollWidth=966`; mobile `documentWidth=390`, no page overflow, table regions scroll
  internally at `352→363` and `352→505`; dark mode and reduced motion both active; no page errors.
- Artifact/log/trace link: `/tmp/relay-plan-final-desktop.png` and
  `/tmp/relay-plan-final-mobile.png` in the handoff machine, plus the round-5 `CLEAN` verdict.
- Oracle proved: current plan is visually usable at representative desktop/mobile widths, table
  overflow is contained, dark/reduced-motion media behavior activates, and an independent reviewer
  found no remaining actionable implementation, regression, security, cross-platform, release,
  evidence, HTML, or Markdown issue.
- Does not prove: product implementation or runtime behavior; all implementation checklist boxes
  remain open until backed by implementation evidence.
- Checklist items satisfied: planning review/validation only; none of Milestones 0–14.
- Follow-up: implementation agent must begin at Milestone 0/1, maintain this checklist, and attach
  evidence before marking any product item complete.

### E-M0-UNIT-001 — Coherent Node/npm resolver and legacy deploy regression suite

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `1ef0551bc138724d736583eac788f4183bef07e2` plus uncommitted Work Package 0 changes; no PR created
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64, native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0 (repository requests Node 24)
- Remote: local POSIX shell fixture for the guarded-NVM case; mocked Windows PowerShell command
  construction; no live SSH remote in this entry
- Transport/network: local Vitest only
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-remote-node-resolution.test.ts
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-remote-node-toolchain-resolution.test.ts
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-native-deps-install.test.ts
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-versioned-install.test.ts
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-deploy.test.ts
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-cross-version-isolation.test.ts
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-remote-platform-detection.test.ts
  ```

- Result: PASS; respectively 32/32, 8/8, 16/16, 26/26, 21/21, 1/1, and 6/6 tests
- Duration and resource metrics: respectively 577 ms, 1.21 s, 634 ms, 538 ms, 642 ms, 546 ms,
  and 156 ms Vitest duration; resource usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local command output; source fixtures in
  `ssh-remote-node-toolchain-resolution.test.ts`
- Oracle proved: POSIX and Windows probes require colocated Node/npm, Node 18 minimum remains,
  missing/failing/no-op npm candidates are skipped, guarded NVM is found without sourcing it,
  startup noise is marker-bounded, non-POSIX login shells receive a `/bin/sh`-wrapped toolchain
  probe, strict session-limit errors/cancellation remain classified, and the selected NVM bin
  directory reaches legacy `npm install`.
- Does not prove: live SSH, live Windows, system SSH, `MaxSessions=1` on a real server, release
  artifacts, or an executable red run against the pre-fix source. The original #8450 report is the
  field red observation; these green tests are discriminating but were not run after temporarily
  reverting user-owned code.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 0 coherent pairing, negative cases, version enforcement,
  strategy/cancellation/session-limit preservation, and focused resolver/deploy verification.
- Follow-up: keep this work package separate; add live Windows or `MaxSessions=1` evidence only if
  those claims are needed for a later support matrix.

### E-M0-LIVE-001 — Ubuntu 24.04 guarded-NVM relay and PTY reproduction

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `1ef0551bc138724d736583eac788f4183bef07e2` plus uncommitted Work Package 0 changes; no PR created
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native client; Docker 29.2.1; Electron 43.1.0
- Remote: Ubuntu 24.04 Linux arm64/glibc container
  (`sha256:4fbb8e6a8395de5a7550b33509421a2bafbc0aab6c06ba2cef9ebffbc7092d90`);
  system Node v18.19.1 with no sibling npm; NVM-layout Node v22.22.3/npm 10.9.8 below a
  non-interactive `.bashrc` return guard; build-essential and Python present for the legacy native
  dependency install
- Transport/network: authenticated built-in SSH2 over Docker loopback; SFTP relay upload; remote
  registry and Node header egress available for the legacy npm install
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  pnpm run test:e2e:ssh-node-toolchain-resolution
  SKIP_BUILD=1 pnpm run test:e2e:ssh-node-toolchain-resolution
  ```

- Result: PASS twice; one purpose-named Playwright test passed on each run
- Duration and resource metrics: fresh Electron/relay build plus E2E 1.8 minutes; repeated E2E 1.2
  minutes with test evidence `durationMs=62553`; memory/channel/file counts not instrumented for this
  narrow legacy resolver proof
- Artifact/log/trace link: local Playwright stdout included
  `systemNode=v18.19.1 nvmNode=v22.22.3 npm=10.9.8 selected=nvm relayPty=pass`;
  fixture and runner are checked into this worktree
- Oracle proved: non-interactive and login-shell PATH both expose the incomplete system Node, the
  complete NVM directory remains discoverable below the guard, Orca connects, the detached relay's
  argv[0] is the NVM Node path, and a marker round-trips through a real remote PTY.
- Does not prove: Linux x64, musl, Windows, macOS remote, system SSH, `MaxSessions=1`, blocked remote
  egress, absence of build tools, fallback behavior, performance budgets, or bundled runtimes.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 0 exact live #8450 reproduction and documented passing legacy
  tuple.
- Follow-up: keep this evidence scoped to the one declared legacy tuple; do not generalize it into a
  bundled or cross-platform support claim.

### E-M0-STATIC-001 — Work Package 0 type, format, line-budget, and diff gates

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `1ef0551bc138724d736583eac788f4183bef07e2` plus uncommitted Work Package 0 changes
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0

  pnpm run check:max-lines-ratchet
  git diff --check
  ```

- Result: PASS
- Duration and resource metrics: typecheck 7.94 s; formatting check 144 ms; other gates under 1 s;
  resource usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local command output
- Oracle proved: Node/CLI/web TypeScript projects compile, touched TypeScript has no oxlint errors,
  all touched files are formatted, no new max-lines bypass exists, and the diff has no whitespace
  errors.
- Does not prove: repository-wide lint completion; see E-M0-LINT-001.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 0 typecheck and max-lines/diff handoff gates.
- Follow-up: resolve or explicitly baseline E-M0-LINT-001 before calling the full lint gate green.

### E-M0-LINT-001 — Repository-wide lint blocked outside Work Package 0

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `1ef0551bc138724d736583eac788f4183bef07e2` plus uncommitted Work Package 0 changes
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote: not applicable
- Transport/network: local only
- Exact command: `pnpm run lint`
- Result: SUPERSEDED for current PR by E-M0-STATIC-002 after rebasing onto `origin/main`; originally
  FAIL after 4.56 s
- Duration and resource metrics: 4.56 s; resource usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local lint output
- Oracle proved: repository-wide oxlint completed with warnings only, then the type-aware
  switch-exhaustiveness subgate failed at the untouched
  `src/renderer/src/components/tab-bar/TerminalTabLeadingIcon.tsx:31` because `active | inactive`
  cases are unhandled.
- Does not prove: a WP0 lint regression. The failing renderer file is clean in `git status` and is
  outside this work package; touched-file oxlint passes in E-M0-STATIC-001.
- Checklist items satisfied: none; the full `pnpm run lint` checkbox remains open.
- Follow-up: none for WP0. Upstream `main` added the missing cases before this branch rebased; the
  full lint command now passes at `c4259d94f` without an authored renderer change in this PR.

- Duration and resource metrics: respectively 461 ms, 1.73 s, 324 ms, 339 ms, 284 ms, 245 ms, and
  189 ms Vitest duration; 10.52 s aggregate wall time; resource usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local command output and the exact sources in PR #8724
- Oracle proved: the focused resolver/deploy contracts from E-M0-UNIT-001 remain green after rebasing
  onto `9d5173252`, including colocated toolchains, guarded NVM, shell-noise markers, cancellation,
  session-limit classification, and propagation of the selected bin directory to npm install.
- Does not prove: live SSH, live Windows, system SSH, a real `MaxSessions=1` server, or bundled runtime
  behavior.
- Checklist items satisfied: refreshed Milestone 0 focused regression gate on the exact PR commit.
- Follow-up: use E-M0-LIVE-002 for the one claimed live tuple and PR CI for additional runner signal.

### E-M0-STATIC-002 — Rebased Work Package 0 full static and repository lint gates

  pnpm run lint
  ```

- Result: PASS; typecheck, 355-entry max-lines ratchet, 12-file formatting check, diff check, and the
  complete repository lint/reliability/localization chain all exited zero
- Duration and resource metrics: typecheck/max-lines/format/diff group 7.39 s; full lint 14.11 s;
  resource usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local command output; exact PR commits
- Oracle proved: the exact rebased PR commit compiles, adds no line-budget bypass, is formatted, has
  no tracked whitespace errors, and passes the full repository lint chain. E-M0-LINT-001 is no
  longer a current blocker; its renderer fix came from upstream `main`, not this PR's authored diff.
- Does not prove: packaged runtime behavior, live SSH, or GitHub-hosted runner behavior.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 0 typecheck, full lint, max-lines, format, and diff gates.
- Follow-up: record the GitHub-hosted `verify` result separately when PR #8724 completes.

  system Node v18.19.1 with no sibling npm; guarded NVM-layout Node v22.22.3/npm 10.9.8
- Transport/network: authenticated built-in SSH2 over Docker loopback; SFTP relay upload; remote
  registry and Node-header egress available for the legacy native dependency install
- Exact command: `pnpm run test:e2e:ssh-node-toolchain-resolution`
- Result: PASS; one purpose-named Playwright test passed
- Duration and resource metrics: test oracle `durationMs=144224`; full build plus E2E 3.2 minutes;
  memory/channel/file counts not instrumented for this narrow legacy resolver proof
- Artifact/log/trace link: local Playwright stdout recorded

- Oracle proved: the exact rebased app/relay build selects the complete guarded NVM toolchain,
  launches the detached relay with that Node, and round-trips a marker through a real remote PTY.
- Does not prove: Linux x64, musl, Windows, macOS remote, system SSH, `MaxSessions=1`, blocked remote
  egress, fallback behavior, performance budgets, or bundled runtimes.
- Checklist items satisfied: refreshed Milestone 0 exact live #8450 reproduction on the PR commit.

- Result: PASS; `verify`, `golden e2e linux experiment`, and `golden e2e mac experiment` all
  completed successfully on the expected PR head
- Duration and resource metrics: verify job 13m13s; Linux golden job 4m23s; macOS golden job 5m57s;
  verify configured a 4 GiB Node heap ceiling but the workflows did not report peak process memory,
  channels, or file counts
- Artifact/log/trace link:

- Oracle proved: the PR head passes repository lint, reliability and max-lines gates, typecheck, Git
  2.25 compatibility, full tests, unpacked-app packaging, packaged CLI smoke, and the existing Linux
  and macOS golden Electron suites.
- Does not prove: live SSH, Windows, Linux arm64, musl, system SSH, SFTP bootstrap transfer,
  `MaxSessions=1`, no-egress remotes, full-size runtime transfer, cancellation/resource budgets, or
  any bundled-runtime behavior. E-M0-LIVE-002 remains the only live SSH claim for WP0.
- Checklist items satisfied: Work Package 0 required PR checks, full repository lint, and independent
  CI boundary.
- Follow-up: keep PR #8724 limited to WP0; use separate work-package branches and purpose-built SSH
  workflows for all later tuple claims.

### E-M1-RUNNER-DECISION-001 — GitHub Actions validation topology decision

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `1ef0551bc138724d736583eac788f4183bef07e2` plus uncommitted planning and Work Package 0 changes
- Runner: documentation decision in the macOS 26.2 arm64 native worktree
- Remote: not applicable; exact native runner labels and representative remotes remain open
- Transport/network: not applicable
- Exact command: no executable runner command applies to the policy decision; both artifacts were
  structurally validated by the exact command recorded in E-M1-ROLLOUT-DECISION-001.
- Result: PASS for recording the user-authorized decision; no runner cell is claimed complete.
- Duration and resource metrics: not applicable to the decision; shared structural validation took
  46 ms.
- Artifact/log/trace link: the Milestone 1 “Validation runner and network topology” section and the
  HTML “GitHub Actions runner policy” callout
- Oracle proved: both planning artifacts name GitHub Actions as the primary orchestrator and define
  when hosted, ephemeral, or self-hosted native execution may fill an evidence cell.
- Does not prove: availability, capacity, permissions, networking, signing access, native execution,
  or any live matrix cell for a concrete runner label.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 runner-provider and qualification-policy decisions only.
- Follow-up: inventory exact labels/images and pin representative POSIX/Windows remotes before
  claiming any tuple.

### E-M1-BASELINE-001 — Conservative initial runtime eligibility baselines

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `a84d52dc6`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; authoritative Node v24.18.0 release/build metadata fetched over
  HTTPS
- Remote: no SSH remote; local AlmaLinux 8 arm64 container reported glibc 2.28 and
  `libstdc++-8.5.0`
- Transport/network: HTTPS to nodejs.org and raw.githubusercontent.com; local Docker execution only
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json | jq -r '[.[] | select(.version | startswith("v24."))][0] | {version,date,lts,security,files}'
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodejs/node/v24.18.0/BUILDING.md | sed -n '65,190p'
  docker run --rm almalinux:8 sh -lc 'uname -m; getconf GNU_LIBC_VERSION; rpm -q libstdc++ glibc'
  ```

- Result: PASS for a decision record. Node v24.18.0 is LTS and publishes official Linux glibc,
  macOS, and Windows archives for x64/arm64. Its supported-platform contract states Linux kernel
  4.18, glibc 2.28, libstdc++ 6.0.25/`GLIBCXX_3.4.25`, macOS 13.5, Windows 10/Server 2016 x64,
  and Windows 10 arm64 minimums. Orca adopts those Linux/macOS floors and stricter Windows floors
  aligned with the declared SSH bootstrap primitives.
- Duration and resource metrics: network reads under 1 s each; local AlmaLinux probe 0.6 s; no
  runtime load or memory metric applies to the policy decision
- Artifact/log/trace link:
  - https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.18.0/
  - https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v24.18.0/BUILDING.md#supported-platforms
- Oracle proved: the recorded minimums do not claim compatibility below the upstream official Node
  binary ABI/OS floors, and musl is excluded because Node publishes no official musl archive.
- Does not prove: any Orca runtime archive, native module, SSH primitive, Rosetta behavior, Windows
  host, minimum-kernel VM, or enabled tuple. Every candidate remains disabled pending live evidence.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 glibc, libstdc++, kernel, musl, macOS, Windows, and Rosetta
  eligibility decisions.
- Follow-up: encode these floors in the manifest/selector contract and fill every target-native live
  cell before enabling a tuple.

### E-M1-NODE-PROVENANCE-001 — Pinned official Node 24 LTS provenance policy

- Remote: not applicable; provenance inputs were verified locally before any extraction or transfer
- Transport/network: HTTPS to nodejs.org and the Node release-key repository; no SSH
- Exact command:

  ```sh

  ```

- Result: PASS; detached signature timestamp `2026-06-23T23:07:59Z` verified with active Node release
  key `C82FA3AE1CBEDC6BE46B9360C43CEC45C17AB93C` (Richard Lau); verified checksum-file SHA-256
  `3927bab574a00ca0560c9583fe19655ba19603a1c5851414e4325d34ac50e469`

  - https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.18.0/SHASUMS256.txt.sig
  - https://github.com/nodejs/release-keys
- Oracle proved: the selected six upstream archives exist and their checksum list has a valid
  signature from the active Node release keyring. The policy pins the exact patch and requires a
  new desktop identity for every refresh.
- Does not prove: that future CI pins rather than mutably fetches the keyring, verifies archives,
  preserves native signatures, builds native modules, meets the CVE SLA, or signs Orca artifacts.
  Those remain implementation/release gates.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 Node version, provenance, musl-source, update/CVE, refresh
  identity, and upstream-signature decisions.
- Follow-up: vendor a reviewed keyring/input digest into the build contract, implement fail-closed
  verification, and add target-native signing/provenance jobs.

### E-M1-RUNNER-INVENTORY-001 — Native GitHub-hosted runner catalog

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `a84d52dc6`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; GitHub runner-image catalog plus repository workflow inventory
- Remote: not applicable; no SSH target is claimed
- Transport/network: HTTPS to the GitHub runner-image catalog and GitHub Actions logs
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actions/runner-images/main/README.md | sed -n '/Available Images/,/Beta Images/p'
  rg -n 'runs-on:' .github/workflows

  gh run view 29325884997 --repo stablyai/orca --job 87061960091 --log
  ```

- Result: PASS for inventory. The catalog exposes native x64/arm64 Linux, macOS, and Windows labels
  selected above and documents weekly image refresh. PR evidence independently resolved
  `ubuntu-latest` to x64 `ubuntu-24.04` image `20260705.232.1` and `macos-15` to arm64
  `macos-15-arm64` image `20260706.0213.1`.
- Duration and resource metrics: catalog fetch 0.2 s; workflow scan 0.1 s; prior log reads under 3 s;
  hosted capacity is unreserved and queue-dependent rather than a fixed resource guarantee
- Artifact/log/trace link:
  - https://github.com/actions/runner-images#available-images
  - E-M0-CI-001 job links
- Oracle proved: explicit native labels exist for the six client/build architectures and new relay
  workflows can avoid mutable `latest` aliases while recording exact resolved images.
- Does not prove: repository access to paid capacity at a future run, runner availability, SSH
  server reachability, cross-family networking, image stability, or any runtime tuple. No approved
  self-hosted target pool was found or inferred.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 runner-label/architecture/image-update/capacity inventory.
- Follow-up: pin representative remote images/snapshots, provision cross-family endpoints, and run
  a minimal native label smoke before assigning any evidence cell.

### E-M1-DECISION-DOC-001 — Baseline/provenance plan-content validation

  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote: not applicable; documentation/content validation only
- Transport/network: local files only
- Exact command: purpose-built inline Node validation using `marked` and `parse5`, followed by
  `pnpm exec oxfmt --check` for both plan artifacts and `git diff --check`
- Result: PASS; `links=1 fences=2 htmlIds=11 fragmentLinks=9`, no parse/fragment/duplicate-ID,
  formatting, or whitespace findings
- Duration and resource metrics: structural validation 42 ms; formatter check 243 ms; resource
  usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: this checklist and the linked HTML plan
- Oracle proved: both artifacts contain the baseline, Node provenance, musl legacy-only, and explicit
  native-runner inventory decisions and remain structurally valid.
- Does not prove: implementation, live compatibility, runner access, SSH transport, signing, or any
  enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: evidence-backed synchronization of the Milestone 1 decision content in
  both required plan artifacts.
- Follow-up: continue the remaining Milestone 1 gates and keep contract implementation in stacked
  draft PR #8728 with no default behavior change.

- Exact command:
  `pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts src/main/ssh/relay-protocol.test.ts src/main/ssh/ssh-remote-platform-detection.test.ts`
- Result: PASS; 35/35 tests across two files, including Linux/macOS/Windows x64/arm64 parsing and
  conservative unsupported-platform rejection
- Duration and resource metrics: 253 ms; memory, channels, and files not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local Vitest stdout; current `RelayPlatform` source and the living table
- Oracle proved: current source has six deterministic legacy platform identities and rejects unknown
  OS/architectures; the plan now separates those identities from libc-aware bundled candidates and
  from live fallback claims.
- Does not prove: a live SSH connection, native npm install, PTY/watcher health, libc compatibility,
  or fallback on any family. E-M0-LIVE-002 remains the only live legacy evidence in this project.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 legacy-versus-bundled family inventory.
- Follow-up: fill current legacy E2E cells before allowing automatic fallback for each corresponding
  bundled tuple.

  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Docker Desktop native arm64 Linux containers
- Remote: local Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12/bookworm-slim, and AlmaLinux 8 arm64 containers; no SSH
  daemon, Windows host, or BusyBox image
- Transport/network: Docker stdin/stdout only; the fixture exercised the proposed raw per-file
  stream but not an authenticated SSH channel
- Exact command: inline Node harness spawned each image with `docker run --rm -i ... sh -c`, sent a
  ten-byte fixture containing NUL/CR/LF/high-bit bytes, and required exact output after
  `mkdir`/`cat`/`chmod`/`mv`/`test`/`nohup`/`rm`
- Result: PASS; exact ten-byte round trip on Ubuntu 24.04, Debian bookworm-slim, and AlmaLinux 8
- Duration and resource metrics: Ubuntu 4,384 ms, Debian 569 ms, AlmaLinux 506 ms including container
  startup; one stdin/stdout stream; peak memory and open-file counts not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local harness stdout recorded in the implementation session
- Oracle proved: the declared POSIX command subset can preserve the binary fixture without Node,
  Python, Perl, tar, base64, or checksum tools on three glibc userlands.
- Does not prove: SSH framing, cancellation, short/extra input rejection, concurrency,
  `MaxSessions=1`, BusyBox, Windows PowerShell/.NET, exclusive lock races, full-size transfer, or
  complete-tree verification.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 POSIX/Windows primitive, per-connection probe, and
  compatibility-failure decisions only. Windows is a specified contract, not executable evidence.
- Follow-up: turn this into purpose-named unit/live tests, add BusyBox and bounded Windows binary
  transfer, and do not enable any tuple from this local semantic probe.

### E-M1-BUSYBOX-001 — BusyBox-only primitive baseline fails closed

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `5c37e8efe`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 Docker container
- Remote: BusyBox v1.36.1, Ubuntu package `1:1.36.1-6ubuntu3.1`; no SSH daemon
- Transport/network: Docker stdin and Ubuntu package mirror; no SSH
- Exact command: install BusyBox, enumerate applets, install its applet symlinks into an isolated
  `PATH`, then run the declared `sh`/`cat`/`mkdir`/`rm`/`mv`/`chmod`/`test`/`nohup` semantic probe
- Result: PASS for fail-conservative classification; the probe exited 127 because this BusyBox build
  provides all declared applets except `nohup`, so it is ineligible and must select legacy
- Duration and resource metrics: 4.6 s including package installation; one container/process stream;
  peak memory not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: local stdout recorded
  `BusyBox v1.36.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.36.1-6ubuntu3.1) multi-call binary`; applet inventory omitted `nohup`
- Oracle proved: the selector cannot infer compatibility from “BusyBox 1.36.1” alone and the exact
  declared primitive probe rejects this variant rather than attempting a partial bundled install.
- Does not prove: Alpine's BusyBox build, BusyBox plus an external `nohup`, SSH behavior, or any
  passing BusyBox tuple. No BusyBox bundled support is claimed.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 initial BusyBox variant record and deterministic disable
  rule.
- Follow-up: add this missing-`nohup` case to the committed selector/primitive suite and retain
  legacy unless a complete BusyBox environment passes live SSH evidence.

### E-M1-BUDGET-DECISION-001 — Fail-closed resource, timeout, and rollout budgets

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `5c37e8efe`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: documentation decision in the macOS 26.2 arm64 native worktree
- Remote: not applicable; measured legacy and bundled baselines remain open
- Transport/network: not applicable; the decision defines later 1/10/100 Mbps and 50/100/200 ms
  shaped tests
- Exact command: plan/checklist content validation plus arithmetic review of every byte/count/time
  ceiling; no runtime benchmark is represented by this entry
- Result: PASS for recording release-blocking upper bounds and paired comparison rules; no
  performance gate is claimed passed
- Duration and resource metrics: decision/content validation only; runtime metrics intentionally
  absent until the baseline harness is implemented
- Artifact/log/trace link: “Operational budgets and rollout policy” in this checklist and “Hard
  resource and latency budgets” in the HTML plan
- Oracle proved: implementation now has explicit rejection, cache, memory, concurrency, timeout,
  cancellation, warm/cold latency, fallback-delay, and legacy-retention thresholds to test against.
- Does not prove: that the limits fit the final full-size archive, that either implementation stays
  below them, hosted-runner stability, or any baseline/regression result. Those boxes remain open.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 cache/archive/time/memory/channel/latency/fallback-duration,
  paired-runner-method, and offline/missing-asset policy decisions.
- Follow-up: measure legacy first, instrument file/channel/memory/cancellation metrics, and revise
  both plan files before implementation only if evidence proves a limit infeasible.

### E-M1-TRUST-DECISION-001 — Manifest and native-signing trust policy

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `5c37e8efe`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native for local Ed25519 probe; historical native Windows Server 2022 x64
  GitHub-hosted signing rehearsal jobs
- Remote: not applicable; no SSH transfer or target-native execution of a relay artifact
- Transport/network: local `tweetnacl` sign/verify plus GitHub Actions/SignPath artifact round trips
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  rg -n 'tweetnacl|CSC_LINK|APPLE_ID|SIGNPATH|SignPath|Get-AuthenticodeSignature' package.json .github/workflows config
  node --input-type=module <inline-tweetnacl-sign-mutate-verify-harness>
  gh run view 28987534795 --repo stablyai/orca --json status,conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt,url,jobs
  gh run view 28988432001 --repo stablyai/orca --json status,conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt,url,jobs
  ```

- Result: PASS for technical feasibility and existing Windows signing evidence. The local probe made
  and verified a 64-byte Ed25519 signature with `tweetnacl`, derived the SHA-256 public-key ID, and
  rejected a changed payload. SignPath test-policy run `28987534795` and release-policy run
  `28988432001` both signed/restored inner PE files, rebuilt/signed the installer, and passed
  end-to-end signature verification.
- Duration and resource metrics: local Ed25519 probe under 0.1 s; test SignPath job 10m7s; production
  SignPath rehearsal 17m24s; signing memory not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link:
  - https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/28987534795/job/86019904578
  - https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/28988432001/job/86022677749
- Oracle proved: the chosen signature primitive works through an already packaged dependency, and
  the repository's existing Windows release machinery can return signed inner native bytes before
  final packaging/hashing.
- Does not prove: canonical serializer implementation, protected manifest environment/secret,
  dual-key rotation, revocation, action-SHA pinning, artifact attestations, macOS relay-native
  signing/notarization, key custody, WDAC/Gatekeeper/AV, or any signed relay runtime. Those remain
  release-blocking implementation/operational gates.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 algorithm, canonical-byte, key-custody policy, rotation,
  anti-rollback, keyless-provenance, and native macOS/Windows signing decisions only.
- Follow-up: implement hostile-input/canonical/signature tests without real secrets, then provision
  and rehearse the protected environment before any release workflow can sign a manifest.

### E-M1-ENDPOINT-DECISION-001 — Native trust validation environment contract

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `5c37e8efe`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: documentation decision in the macOS 26.2 arm64 native worktree
- Remote: no approved macOS 13.5, Windows Server 2022/Windows 11 arm64, or WDAC-enforced snapshot was
  executed
- Transport/network: not applicable
- Exact command: repository signing-workflow inspection plus synchronized checklist/HTML content
  validation; no endpoint-protection command is represented by this decision entry
- Result: PASS for defining exact target-native environments and fail-closed outcomes; all execution
  gates remain open
- Duration and resource metrics: decision/content validation only
- Artifact/log/trace link: Milestone 1 trust section and HTML “OS-native trust controls” risk
- Oracle proved: future Gatekeeper/Defender/WDAC evidence has concrete OS/architecture, quarantine,
  policy mode, identity logging, and release-blocking requirements.
- Does not prove: snapshot/provider availability, policy ownership, actual signature acceptance,
  antivirus behavior, native loading, PTY/watcher smoke, or any endpoint-protection pass.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 1 endpoint-protection environment decision only.
- Follow-up: provision or approve the snapshot pool and keep every affected tuple disabled until the
  target-native runs pass.

### E-M1-DECISION-DOC-002 — Remaining Milestone 1 plan-content validation

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `5c37e8efe`; stacked draft PR
  [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote: not applicable; documentation/content validation only
- Transport/network: local files only
- Exact command: purpose-built inline Node validation using `marked` and `parse5`, required-content
  assertions for all newly recorded Milestone 1 decisions, `pnpm exec oxfmt --check` on both
  artifacts, and `git diff --check`
- Result: PASS; `links=1 fences=2 htmlIds=11 fragmentLinks=9`, no
  parse/fragment/duplicate-ID/content/format/whitespace findings
- Duration and resource metrics: structural validation 42 ms; formatter check 253 ms; resource
  usage not instrumented
- Artifact/log/trace link: this checklist and the linked HTML plan
- Oracle proved: both artifacts contain synchronized legacy-family, bootstrap, BusyBox,
  offline/fallback, numeric-budget, manifest-trust, native-signing, and endpoint-environment decisions
  and remain structurally valid.
- Does not prove: implementation, measured budget compliance, key provisioning, native trust, live
  transfer, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: evidence-backed synchronization of the remaining safely decidable
  Milestone 1 policy content.
- Follow-up: keep unresolved remote-pool and measured-baseline gates open while contract-only work
  proceeds without secrets or a runtime behavior switch.

### E-M2-RED-001 — Missing contract modules and canonical-vector red baseline

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: `959bc05caca7e5ccb4c69b47c1bf6f5b47671c57` plus uncommitted Work
  Package 1 tests; stacked draft PR [#8728](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8728)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote: not applicable; pure local contract tests
- Transport/network: local Vitest only; no SSH or GitHub request
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts \
    src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-schema.test.ts \
    src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-runtime-identity.test.ts \
    src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-manifest-signature.test.ts \
    src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-release-asset.test.ts \
    src/main/ssh/ssh-relay-artifact-selector.test.ts
  ```

- Result: FAIL as the intended executable red baseline: signature and selector suites failed to
  import because their production modules did not exist; the identity vector still contained its
  explicit replacement marker; and one native-package fixture reached the undeclared-parent guard
  before the intended native-package guard. Four files failed, one passed, with 35 tests executed
  (33 passed and 2 failed) plus two import-failed suites.
- Duration and resource metrics: 292 ms Vitest duration; no runtime-transfer resources apply.
- Artifact/log/trace link: local command output retained in the implementation session; test paths
  above are the durable repro.
- Oracle proved: the new tests were discriminating before the missing signature/selector modules and
  canonical vector were implemented, and the native-package fixture needed to preserve tree
  consistency to reach its intended oracle.
- Does not prove: behavior before all schema/identity files existed, live SSH, a real archive,
  cryptographic key custody, target-native execution, or any production-path failure.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the Work Package 1 contract-test gate only.
- Follow-up: implemented and superseded for green behavior by E-M2-CONTRACT-001; retained as red
  history.

- Result: PASS locally. Five suites passed with 68/68 tests; Node/CLI/web typecheck passed; the full
  repository lint/reliability/localization chain exited zero with pre-existing warnings only; the
  355-entry max-lines ratchet reported no new bypass; touched-file formatting and tracked diff checks
  passed.
- Duration and resource metrics: final Vitest duration 540 ms (1.33 s wall); typecheck 3.91 s; full
  lint 23.62 s; formatting check 874 ms; max-lines and diff checks under 1 s. Runtime memory,
  channels, handles, files, and cancellation do not apply to this disconnected pure contract layer
  and were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: local command output; canonical runtime identity vector

  draft PR #8728
- Oracle proved: strict versioned parsing; bounded sizes/counts; portable path and special-entry
  rejection; required runtime closure and executable Node mode; tuple/archive/attestation
  cross-consistency; stable content identity; exact stable/RC/perf tag and direct-URL rules; initial
  and dual Ed25519 signing with canonical unsigned bytes; unknown/malformed/duplicate/mismatched
  key failure; conservative Linux glibc/musl, macOS, Windows-bootstrap, translated-process, unknown,
  old, unavailable, and ambiguous selection.
- Does not prove: Node 24 execution, real archive parsing/extraction, local cache/download, target
  probes, SSH/SFTP/system-SSH transfer, runtime build/native loading, signing environment custody,
  release publication, fallback state, UI rollout, performance, or any live matrix cell. No module
  is connected to a production call site and no tuple is enabled.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 2 manifest-schema, signed-content, content-identity,
  release-name/URL, schema-level hostile path/type, and pure selector contract items explicitly
  marked above; verification command inventory entry.
- Follow-up: push and record the exact GitHub Actions result, then begin Work Package 2 target-native

  ```

- Result: PASS. The `verify` job completed successfully on the exact PR head; repository lint,
  reliability gates, max-lines, typecheck, Git 2.25 compatibility, 2,803 passing test files with
  29,695 passing tests, unpacked Linux app packaging, packaged daemon load, and packaged CLI smoke
  all passed. Nine test files and 55 tests were intentionally skipped by the existing suite.
- Duration and resource metrics: 11m52s from `2026-07-14T11:44:44Z` to
  `2026-07-14T11:56:36Z`; the workflow did not report peak memory, channel, handle, or file counts.
- Artifact/log/trace link:
  https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29329963564/job/87075275741
- Oracle proved: Work Package 1 compiles and passes the repository's full PR regression/package gate
  under the pinned Node 24 runtime on a native Linux x64 runner; PR #8728 is draft, open, and reports
  a clean merge state at the checked head.
- Does not prove: live SSH, Linux arm64, macOS, Windows, musl, archive assembly/extraction, native
  runtime execution, signing, release assets, download/cache, transfer/install, fallback, UI,
  performance budgets, or any enabled tuple. The existing relay build exercised by packaging remains
  the legacy JavaScript build, not a self-contained runtime artifact.
- Checklist items satisfied: Work Package 1 exact-head PR CI gate only; no live matrix or runtime
  tuple cell.
- Follow-up: keep PR #8728 draft and isolated; begin Work Package 2 on a new stacked branch with no
  production consumer.

- Commit SHA / PR: `0c299fe189310b6dbd539f0f0f506b240524ba6a` plus uncommitted Work Package 2 test; no Work Package 2 PR yet
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64 native; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote: not applicable; local test discovery only
- Transport/network: none
- Exact command:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-release-verification.test.mjs
  ```

- Result: expected FAIL before implementation. Vitest could not import the intentionally missing
  `config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-release-verification.mjs`; one suite failed before collecting tests.
- Duration and resource metrics: 136 ms Vitest duration; archive/runtime resources do not apply.
- Artifact/log/trace link: durable test path above; local command output retained in the
  implementation session.
- Oracle proved: the focused suite was discriminating before the verifier facade and domain modules
  existed.
- Does not prove: any validation behavior, cryptographic verification, downloaded byte, archive,
  extraction, runtime execution, SSH behavior, or platform tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the Milestone 3 Node provenance implementation gate only.
- Follow-up: green implementation and real release-input proof are recorded in
  E-M3-NODE-PROVENANCE-001.

- Runner: focused tests on macOS 26.2 arm64 with Node v26.0.0/pnpm 10.24.0; real proof in
  Docker Engine 29.2.1 on Linux/arm64 using `node:24-bookworm` resolved to
  `node@sha256:032e78d7e54e352129831743737e3a83171d9cc5b5896f411649c597ce0b11ea`,

      node config/scripts/verify-ssh-relay-node-release-inputs.mjs --inputs-directory /tmp/node-inputs --archive linux-x64-glibc'
  ```

- Result: PASS. Seven focused tests passed. The real verifier accepted the pinned release-key hash
  `84b1ca614406f341cb86e72920f5a64687a13ab67ab84038bcf2abba97898a84`, exact signer

  checksum entries, and the 31,511,588-byte Linux x64 archive hash
  `55aa7153f9d88f28d765fcdad5ae6945b5c0f98a36881703817e4c450fa76742`.
- Duration and resource metrics: final focused Vitest duration 160 ms; container provisioning,
  metadata download, archive download, and verification completed in approximately 11 seconds.
  Peak memory and network bytes were not instrumented; the accepted archive size was 31,511,588
  bytes and hashing was streaming/bounded.
- Artifact/log/trace link: committed contract, pinned ASCII release key, purpose-named verifier
  modules/CLI, and local command output; no artifact was published or retained in the repository.
- Oracle proved: strict immutable six-tuple contract validation; bounded metadata/archive hashing;
  exact release-key bytes; detached-signature success through gpgv; exact signer fingerprint;
  authenticated checksum-to-archive cross-checking; duplicate/malformed/missing/mismatched input
  rejection in focused tests; and one real official Linux x64 archive byte hash.
- Does not prove: archive safety or extraction, Linux x64 execution (the container was arm64), any
  bundled Node/native dependency/PTY/watcher behavior, the other five archive downloads, target-native
  assembly/signing, SSH transfer, release publication, cache behavior, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: Milestone 3 pinned Node/downloaded-binary checksum/upstream-signature
  implementation gate and the two Milestone 3 verification-command inventory entries only.
- Follow-up: assemble the first runtime on a target-native runner, inspect its archive, execute its
  bundled Node and native dependencies, then fill only the evidence cells actually proved.

    config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-smoke-child.cjs
  ```

- Result: discriminating discovery. Orca's daemon PTY spawn passes `useConptyDll: true` on Windows.
  Pinned `node-pty@1.1.0` supplies architecture-specific `conpty.dll` and `OpenConsole.exe` under
  `third_party/conpty/1.23.251008001/win10-{x64,arm64}` and its postinstall copies those files to
  `build/Release/conpty`. The candidate directly invoked `node-gyp`, copied only `conpty.node` and
  `conpty_console_list.node`, and smoked with `useConpty: true` but not `useConptyDll: true`.
- Oracle proved: the candidate artifact could pass its proposed smoke while omitting files required
  by the production relay PTY configuration. Both plan artifacts now require the exact ConPTY
  runtime closure and production-mode smoke before a Windows executable cell can pass.
- Does not prove: corrected staging, artifact-tree identity, ConPTY execution, Authenticode/native
  trust, Windows build, SSH, transfer, install, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: none; this is a red gap record and its implementation item remains open.
- Follow-up: stage the tuple-specific files without running an implicit downloader, copy and hash
  them into the runtime, use `useConptyDll: true` in native smoke, and obtain Windows x64/arm64 CI
  evidence before checking the implementation item.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-INPUT-GAP-001 — Windows ZIP lacks native build inputs

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: investigation while implementing the Windows artifact-only slice in draft PR
  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741); no Windows artifact was produced or enabled
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; `curl` plus system `unzip`; inspection only
- Remote and transport: exact HTTPS download from
  `https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.18.0/node-v24.18.0-win-x64.zip`; no SSH or release upload
- Exact commands:

  ```sh
  curl --fail --silent --show-error --location --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \
    --connect-timeout 20 --max-time 300 --retry 2 --retry-delay 2 --retry-all-errors \
    https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.18.0/node-v24.18.0-win-x64.zip \
    --output /tmp/orca-node-win-input-check/node-v24.18.0-win-x64.zip
  unzip -l /tmp/orca-node-win-input-check/node-v24.18.0-win-x64.zip | \
    rg 'node\\.exe$|include/node/node\\.h$|node\\.lib$|LICENSE$'
  curl --fail --silent --show-error --location --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \

    rg 'headers|win-(x64|arm64)/node\\.lib|win-(x64|arm64)\\.zip'
  ```

- Result: discriminating discovery. The authenticated x64 ZIP contains 2,449 files and 105,728,964
  expanded bytes, including the 92,534,088-byte `node.exe` and root `LICENSE`, but no
  `include/node/node.h` and no `node.lib`. The same signed checksum document authenticates
  `node-v24.18.0-headers.tar.gz` as
  `6c7d41d83c3481d2301115b8ce4a44b7d4fbfa52859b1aac14f445d460137887`,
  `win-x64/node.lib` as
  `589684168a73547ca47cd22d76a4e465ef561abe89fb1b2b23fe35bbe857d505`, and
  `win-arm64/node.lib` as
  `7da03c5111815b69bbe63ffd2e51b28cd69eec9f545b7ccb8756efffdbb88dc2`.
- Oracle proved: the original six-binary-archive contract is insufficient to build `node-pty` on
  Windows without an unrecorded `node-gyp` download. Both plan artifacts now require the signed
  headers archive and per-architecture import library as explicit immutable build inputs.
- Does not prove: headers/import-library download or extraction, Windows build, ZIP determinism,
  bundled Node/ConPTY/watcher execution, signing/trust, SSH, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: Windows build-input policy correction only; implementation remains
  unchecked.
- Follow-up: extend the signed input schema/verifier and hostile-input tests, stage only the required
  headers and `node.lib`, then run the native Windows build with implicit downloads disabled.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-ZIP-RED-001 — Windows ZIP/input contract red gate

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: uncommitted Windows artifact-only tests on top of `c308107a9`; draft PR
  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote and transport: none; synthetic local test discovery only
- Exact command:

    config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-zip.test.mjs \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-zip-inspection.test.mjs
  ```

- Result: expected FAIL before implementation. Both suites failed at import because the deliberately
  missing `ssh-relay-runtime-zip.mjs` and `ssh-relay-node-zip-inspection.mjs` modules did not exist;
  zero tests were collected.
- Duration and resource metrics: 196 ms Vitest duration; archive/runtime resources do not apply.
- Oracle proved: both Windows ZIP boundaries were discriminating before their implementations.
- Does not prove: any ZIP validation, real Node input, Windows build/execution, SSH, or tuple support.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the Windows ZIP/input contract gate only.
- Follow-up: E-M3-WINDOWS-INPUT-001 records the first green implementation and real signed inputs.

       {headersArchivePath:'<headers.tar.gz>',importLibraryPath:'<win-x64/node.lib>'}));"
  ```

- Result: PASS. Six focused suites passed 19/19 tests. The real verifier authenticated signer
  `C82FA3AE1CBEDC6BE46B9360C43CEC45C17AB93C`, the exact signed checksum document, all nine pinned
  release inputs, the 37,176,245-byte x64 ZIP, 9,951,449-byte headers archive, and 2,986,260-byte x64
  import library. Bounded ZIP inspection consumed 2,449 entries/1,984 files/105,728,964 expanded
  bytes and selectively staged only `node.exe` plus `LICENSE`. Bounded headers inspection consumed
  3,326 entries/2,726 files/58,969,198 expanded bytes and staged only `include`; `node.lib` was
  rehashed before and after exclusive copy to `Release/node.lib`.
- Resource and integrity details: all input hashing and archive entry verification streamed; each
  file was bounded by 256 MiB, aggregate input expansion by 1 GiB, path depth by 32, path bytes by
  512, and entries by 100,000. Synthetic runtime ZIP creation was byte-identical for the same tree
  and epoch and rejected extra entries and content mismatch. Peak RSS, open files, and cancellation
  settlement were not instrumented in this local slice.
- Oracle proved: exact schema and signed-checksum coverage for the Windows ZIP, common headers, and
  tuple import library; missing/malformed input rejection; safe portable ZIP paths, traversal and
  case-fold collision rejection; CRC-32 plus SHA-256 streaming; bounded selective extraction; exact
  post-copy hashes; and deterministic synthetic runtime ZIP packing/inspection.
- Does not prove: native Windows `node-pty` build, that `node-gyp` succeeds offline, bundled
  `node.exe`/ConPTY/watcher execution, full-runtime ZIP identity on Windows, Windows x64/arm64
  signing/trust, oldest baseline, SSH/SFTP/system-SSH, release publication, cache/fallback/UI, or any
  enabled tuple. Local `gpg`/`gpgv` were unavailable on macOS, so the signature proof is the pinned
  Linux container command above; Windows jobs explicitly select Git for Windows' bundled tools.
- Checklist items satisfied: explicit signed Windows build-input contract and bounded local staging
  only; no Windows per-tuple build/executable cell is checked.
- Follow-up: run the exact builder on native `windows-2022` and `windows-11-arm`, require the
  loopback-only `node-gyp` fallback URL to remain unused, and record only the cells actually passed.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-LOCAL-002 — Corrected Windows artifact contracts and local static gates

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: implementation commit `922edb6ff28199b394f508731fd18a635bec49a0`;
  draft PR [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0. The repository requires Node 24, so
  exact-head draft-PR CI is the authoritative supported-Node result.
- Remote and transport: none; synthetic contracts and repository static checks only
- Exact commands:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-release-verification.test.mjs \

    docs/reference/plans/2026-07-14-ssh-relay-github-release-plan.html
  git diff --check
  ```

- Result: PASS. Seven focused suites passed 21/21 tests in 290 ms. Typecheck, oxlint, max-lines,
  full lint/reliability/localization gates, plan formatting, and diff whitespace passed. Oxlint
  reported only pre-existing warnings outside this package. Full lint used `GOMAXPROCS=2` because
  the external Go type-aware linter had previously segfaulted on an existing dependency declaration
  at unconstrained concurrency.
- Oracle proved: deterministic synthetic Windows ZIP packing and complete ZIP reinspection;
  signed-input schema and bounded ZIP/header staging contracts; Windows-unsafe header path
  rejection; the Windows runtime-tree identity contains `conpty.dll` and `OpenConsole.exe` as
  native runtime files; the smoke configuration selects `useConptyDll: true`; the workflow declares
  exact x64/arm64 native runners and has read-only, unpublished artifact authority.
- Resource metrics: focused Vitest duration 290 ms. Runtime RSS, open files/channels, cancellation
  settlement, artifact size, and native build/smoke duration do not apply to these synthetic checks
  and remain open for target-native evidence.
- Does not prove: Windows native compilation, offline `node-gyp`, staged ConPTY execution,
  bundled-Node/PTY/watcher smoke, full artifact bytes or reproducibility, native trust/signing,
  oldest baseline, SSH transfer/install, publication, resolver/cache/fallback/UI, or any enabled
  tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: the added purpose-named local Windows-tree command only. Windows
  per-tuple build/executable and ConPTY implementation boxes remain unchecked pending native CI.
- Follow-up: push this exact implementation head and record exact Windows x64/arm64 jobs, images,
  artifact IDs/hashes/sizes, build/verify/smoke durations, RSS, and any discriminating failure.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-002 — First Windows native jobs stopped at contract tests

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: exact workflow head `539cd060e74386ba33bf1291c940b68fba9af13b` containing

  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Run: [SSH Relay Runtime Artifacts 29338911990](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29338911990)
- Native jobs:
  - x64 job `87105197603`: requested `windows-2022`; resolved `win22` image
    `20260706.237.1`, GitHub-hosted X64, Windows Server 2022 Datacenter build 20348, Node v24.18.0;
    failed after 1m17s.
  - arm64 job `87105197605`: requested `windows-11-arm`; resolved `win11-arm64` image
    `20260706.102.1`, GitHub-hosted ARM64, Windows 10 Enterprise build 26200, Node v24.18.0; failed
    after 3m37s.
- Remote and transport: none. Both jobs stopped before Node input download, native build, runtime
  smoke, or artifact upload.
- Exact commands:

  ```sh
  gh api repos/stablyai/orca/actions/jobs/87105197603/logs > /tmp/orca-win-x64-red.log
  gh api repos/stablyai/orca/actions/jobs/87105197605/logs > /tmp/orca-win-arm64-red.log
  rg -n "requested_runner=|resolved_image_os=|resolved_image_version=|runner_arch=|WindowsProductName|WindowsVersion|OsBuildNumber|source_commit=|FAIL|SyntaxError|Node archive is missing" \
    /tmp/orca-win-x64-red.log /tmp/orca-win-arm64-red.log
  ```

- Result: FAIL as a discriminating pre-build gate on both architectures. Each run reported three
  failed and four passed suites, with one failed and ten passed collected tests. The x64 test phase
  took 1.26s; arm64 took 1.33s. `ssh-relay-node-tar-inspection.test.mjs` created its POSIX tar
  fixture from an NTFS file and therefore lost the declared `bin/node` execute bit; the production
  inspector correctly rejected it. `ssh-relay-node-release-verification.test.mjs` and
  `ssh-relay-runtime-artifact.test.mjs` separately failed at import with only `SyntaxError: Invalid
or unexpected token`; the first logs did not identify a source location.
- Discriminating follow-up: exact head `55f7137c6e065481d2f58fed1353df9a75914fc8` reran in
  [run 29339487426](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29339487426). X64 job
  `87107170544` proved the explicit tar-mode correction: five suites and all 11 collected tests
  passed in 1.24s. Only the same two import-time syntax errors remained. Both failing suites import
  a command-line `.mjs` file with a Unix shebang, while every supported call site already invokes
  those files through `node`; the next correction removes only those unused shebangs and preserves
  the CLI main guards.
- Second follow-up: exact head `ef94c90663740c657d44e93f758c99016e66b61a` reran in
  [run 29339742904](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29339742904). X64 job
  `87108126824` collected all seven suites and 21 tests, proving the shebang correction. Eighteen
  tests passed, one POSIX archive test skipped as designed, and two Windows-specific assertions
  failed in 1.17s: Git checkout converted the pinned armored key from LF to CRLF, and a POSIX
  `chmod(0o600)` rejection assertion ran even though the Windows verifier intentionally takes modes
  from verified ZIP metadata. The received key hash
  `25cc2da386fe54cfc6a3d683f1df2a5f636014a31be8efadd73a9ecc2208dbec` exactly matches
  `sed 's/$/\r/' <pinned-key> | shasum -a 256`; the committed LF bytes remain
  `84b1ca614406f341cb86e72920f5a64687a13ab67ab84038bcf2abba97898a84`.
- Oracle proved: both requested hosted runner labels resolve to native Node 24 environments, MSVC
  setup succeeds, Git for Windows supplies both required GPG tools, frozen source installation
  succeeds, and the test command stops the artifact build before any download or upload. It also
  discriminated one cross-platform fixture assumption.
- Does not prove: that the explicit-mode fixture correction is green on Windows; the cause of the
  two import-time syntax errors; Node input download/signature verification; native compilation;
  offline `node-gyp`; bundled Node/ConPTY/watcher execution; ZIP output; native trust; SSH; or any
  enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: exact Windows runner-label resolution only. No Windows build,
  executable, archive, or artifact cell is checked.
- Follow-up: mark the pinned armored key `-text` so checkout preserves its authenticated bytes,
  keep the filesystem-mode mutation assertion POSIX-only, and rerun both native architectures.
  Continue to block input download/build until all seven suites pass.

    rg -n -C 12 "SSH relay runtime build failed|gpgv rejected|invalid key resource|Process completed with exit code"
  ```

- Result: FAIL as a discriminating signed-input gate on both architectures. All seven focused suites
  collected on each runner; 20 tests passed and one POSIX-only test skipped as designed in 1.17s on
  x64 and 1.47s on arm64. Exact Node inputs downloaded successfully. Git for Windows `gpgv` then
  rejected the exclusive verified-copy keyring path before signature acceptance:
  `invalid key resource URL 'C:\\...\\release-key.gpg'`. GnuPG interprets the drive-letter colon
  as a resource-URL scheme at this option boundary. Both runners failed closed with `No public key`;
  no unverified archive was extracted or executed.
- Oracle proved: the preceding fixture, shebang, checkout-byte, and filesystem-mode corrections are
  green on both native Windows architectures; exact release inputs are downloadable; the production
  signature gate executes and prevents unverified bytes from progressing. The identical x64/arm64
  failure isolates command-path representation rather than architecture-specific cryptography.
- Does not prove: successful Windows signature verification, archive/header/import-library
  extraction, offline `node-gyp`, native compilation, bundled Node/ConPTY/watcher execution, ZIP
  output or determinism, native trust/signing, oldest baseline, SSH, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: Windows contract-test portability and fail-closed signed-input behavior
  only. No Windows build, executable, archive, or artifact cell is checked.
- Follow-up: run both GPG commands in the exclusive verified-copy directory with cwd-relative paths,
  assert the command boundary never receives an absolute drive-letter path, and rerun both native
  architectures before any broader Windows correction.

- Exact command:
  `pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-release-verification.test.mjs`
- Result: expected FAIL; one new test failed and seven existing tests passed in 163 ms. The failure
  diff showed absolute temporary paths passed to both `gpg --output` and `gpgv --keyring`, while the
  required oracle expected cwd-relative verified-copy names and a common exclusive working directory.
- Oracle proved: the regression test discriminates the exact command representation rejected by Git
  for Windows in E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-003 without weakening signature/fingerprint validation.
- Does not prove: real GPG execution, Windows compatibility, successful signature verification,
  archive extraction/build/smoke, or any tuple support.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the Windows GPG path-portability correction only.
- Follow-up: add cwd support to the bounded command runner, pass only explicit relative verified-copy
  names, rerun this focused suite, and require native x64/arm64 CI before claiming the correction.

- Result: PASS. The focused signature suite passed 8/8 tests in 151 ms; all seven artifact suites
  passed 22/22 tests in 313 ms. Typecheck, full oxlint, max-lines ratchet, full
  lint/reliability/localization gates, plan formatting, and diff whitespace passed. Oxlint reported
  only existing warnings outside this package; full lint used `GOMAXPROCS=2` for the previously
  recorded external Go linter stability constraint.
- Oracle proved: both GPG invocations share the exclusive verified-copy directory as their cwd and
  receive only explicit `./` paths for the key, keyring, checksum, and signature; existing hash,
  command-failure, and exact-fingerprint tests remain green.
- Does not prove: real GPG execution, Git for Windows compatibility, Node 24 support, Windows native
  build/smoke, archive output, or any tuple support.
- Checklist items satisfied: local green half of the path-portability correction only. Native CI is
  still mandatory before the E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-003 failure is considered corrected.
- Follow-up: run the exact correction on Windows x64/arm64 and all four POSIX artifact jobs, then
  record any next discriminating native boundary without broadening this work package.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-CI-RED-004 — Native Windows assembly reached an opaque bounded smoke timeout

- Date: 2026-07-14

- Run: [SSH Relay Runtime Artifacts 29340686444](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29340686444),
  conclusion `failure`; all four POSIX regression jobs passed and uploaded only unpublished
  seven-day Actions artifacts.
- Native Windows jobs:
  - x64 job `87111302431`: `windows-2022`, resolved `win22` image `20260706.237.1`, GitHub-hosted
    X64, Windows Server 2022 Datacenter build 20348, Node v24.18.0; failed after 4m37s.
  - arm64 job `87111302486`: `windows-11-arm`, resolved `win11-arm64` image `20260706.102.1`,
    GitHub-hosted ARM64, Windows 10 Enterprise build 26200, Node v24.18.0; failed after 7m9s.
- Remote and transport: no SSH remote. Exact inputs came from `nodejs.org/dist/v24.18.0`; no release
  publication or Windows artifact upload occurred.
- Exact commands:

  ```sh
  gh run view 29340686444 --repo stablyai/orca \

  gh api --paginate repos/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29340686444/artifacts
  ```

- Result: FAIL at the native bundled smoke on both architectures. Each runner passed all seven
  contract suites with 21 passing and one intentionally skipped test, authenticated the exact Node
  checksum/signature plus ZIP/headers/import library, compiled the patched native modules, assembled
  and reinspected a 60-entry/42-file deterministic-format ZIP, and entered verification's smoke only
  after archive/tree integrity checks. X64 produced a 37,212,065-byte ZIP expanding to 97,248,414
  bytes, content ID `90823b2c6bf7dad748a4399fe74fdfa8be82ef4a00d727e3a6be173f274fd43f`,
  archive SHA-256 `ee7634dea179026b3ba8232294016d939e32edc34e1fd3697dd9e11722285d6a`,
  and 146,511.617 ms build duration. Arm64 produced a 33,261,531-byte ZIP expanding to 86,189,740
  bytes, content ID `09ec2772bb8c47ee240fd226963b7e251a8060e7f84321cb24d2668bf993e2ca`,

  and 176,108.728 ms build duration.
- Failure boundary: each bundled-Node smoke exceeded the parent command's 45-second timeout. The
  child already bounds PTY and watcher waits at 15 seconds and writes its classified failure to
  stderr, but `verify-ssh-relay-runtime.mjs` currently reports only the generic `execFile` stack.
  The logs therefore cannot distinguish PTY, watcher, cleanup-handle, or combined failure. Upload
  remained skipped. Smoke RSS, channel/file counts, and cancellation settlement were not emitted.
- Oracle proved: the GPG relative-path correction works through real Git-for-Windows GPG on native
  x64 and arm64; signed-input gating, offline native build inputs, patched native compilation,
  bundled Node v24.18.0 staging, ZIP construction/inspection, and pre-execution archive/tree gates
  all precede the failing smoke. The four POSIX jobs remain green on the exact same source head.
- Does not prove: successful Windows PTY/ConPTY/watcher execution, which smoke substage failed,
  prompt child-process settlement, ZIP clean-rebuild identity, durable Windows artifact bytes,
  native trust/signing, oldest baseline, SSH, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native GPG path portability and pre-smoke Windows assembly progression
  only. Windows per-tuple cells remain unchecked because executable smoke and artifact retention did
  not pass.
- Follow-up: preserve bounded child stdout, stderr, timeout, exit, and signal details in the parent
  diagnostic; add a failure-path unit test; rerun x64 first and change no PTY/watcher behavior until
  the classified child failure is visible.

  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote and transport: none; synthetic child-process error object only
- Exact command:
  `pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-artifact.test.mjs`
- Result: expected FAIL; the new diagnostic test failed and three existing tests passed in 239 ms
  because `formatSshRelayRuntimeSmokeFailure` did not exist. The required oracle supplies timeout,
  exit/signal state, partial stdout, and a greater-than-limit stderr whose final classified failure
  must survive explicit truncation.
- Oracle proved: existing parent diagnostics cannot satisfy the bounded failure-detail contract and
  the new test discriminates both missing metadata and unbounded/error-tail-losing implementations.
- Does not prove: child execution, Windows behavior, the actual PTY/watcher failure, cleanup
  settlement, or any tuple support.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the smoke-diagnostic correction only.
- Follow-up: implement a 64-KiB tail-preserving formatter around the already 4-MiB-bounded child
  process, wrap `execFile` failure with it, and rerun focused/static gates before native x64 CI.

- Result: PASS. The focused artifact suite passed 4/4 tests in 194 ms; all seven artifact suites
  passed 23/23 tests in 293 ms. Typecheck, focused and full oxlint, max-lines ratchet, full
  lint/reliability/localization gates, plan formatting, and diff whitespace passed. Full lint
  reported only existing warnings outside this package and used the recorded `GOMAXPROCS=2`
  stability constraint.
- Oracle proved: any failed bundled-smoke child now propagates the declared 45-second parent timeout,
  exit code, kill state, signal, message, stdout, and stderr; each stream retains at most its final
  64 KiB with an explicit omitted-byte count. The real command remains capped at 4 MiB and no
  success-path parsing or smoke behavior changed.
- Does not prove: real child failure propagation on Windows, which PTY/watcher stage fails,
  process-tree settlement after timeout, successful native smoke, or any tuple support.
- Checklist items satisfied: local green half of the bounded smoke-diagnostic correction only.
- Follow-up: rerun native Windows x64, capture the classified child tail, and make no execution-path
  change until that evidence identifies the actual failure.

  ```

- Result: expected discriminating FAIL. The exact signed inputs, offline native build, archive and
  complete-tree verification all passed. Bundled Node v24.18.0/ABI 137 then completed the patched
  ConPTY smoke with exit 23, 101×37 resize, input marker, and both native modules loaded from
  `build/Release`; watcher create, update, rename-as-delete/create, and delete also completed. The
  x64 child emitted valid JSON after 3,357.413 ms with 56,905,728-byte RSS; arm64 emitted the same
  functional result after 6,593.663 ms with 54,505,472-byte RSS. Both remained alive until the
  parent killed them at 45 seconds (`code=null`, `killed=true`, `signal="SIGTERM"`, empty stderr).

  expanded bytes; build 248,307.259 ms. Uploads remained skipped because prompt process settlement
  is part of executable proof.
- Oracle proved: Windows x64 and arm64 PTY/ConPTY and watcher functionality succeeds through each
  exact bundled runtime, and the common remaining failure occurs after successful JSON emission in
  child-process handle settlement rather than in PTY, watcher, archive, or tree validation.
- Does not prove: prompt cleanup, durable artifact upload, clean-rebuild identity, native
  trust/signing, oldest baseline, SSH, or any enabled tuple. Both per-tuple rows remain unchecked
  until the child exits normally and exact-head CI retains each artifact.
- Follow-up: retain and dispose the PTY listener subscriptions, call the supported Windows terminal
  cleanup after a validated successful exit, and prove normal child settlement without
  `process.exit()` on both native architectures.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-SMOKE-SETTLEMENT-LOCAL-RED-001 — PTY lifecycle cleanup contract red gate

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: uncommitted contract test and behavior-preserving PTY-smoke module extraction on

  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote and transport: none; injected terminal/listener lifecycle only
- Exact command:
  `pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-pty-smoke.test.mjs`
- Result: expected FAIL in 122 ms. The Windows success case returned a valid exit result but called
  `terminal.kill()` zero times; the POSIX success case and Windows case both disposed zero of their
  three `onData`/`onExit` subscriptions. Two tests failed, with no timeout or synthetic forced exit.
- Oracle proved: the current success path lacks the exact listener and ConPTY cleanup operations
  required by the native x64 diagnostic, and the purpose-named suite distinguishes Windows-only
  terminal cleanup from platform-neutral listener disposal.
- Does not prove: the green implementation, actual Windows handle release, timeout/error cleanup,
  full child-process settlement, arm64 behavior, or any tuple support.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the Windows PTY smoke-settlement correction only.
- Follow-up: add idempotent finally cleanup, preserve successful POSIX no-kill behavior, rerun this
  suite and all artifact/static gates, then require exact-head native Windows CI.

- Result: PASS. The lifecycle suite passed 2/2 tests in 117 ms; the eight artifact suites passed
  25/25 tests in 417 ms. Typecheck, focused oxlint, max-lines ratchet, full
  lint/reliability/localization checks, formatting, and diff whitespace passed. Full lint reported
  only pre-existing warnings outside this package.
- Oracle proved: the success path retains and disposes both data subscriptions and the exit
  subscription exactly once; a validated Windows exit additionally calls the supported node-pty
  terminal cleanup exactly once, while a successful POSIX exit does not kill its terminal. Cleanup
  is in `finally`, the existing timeout/error path still kills the terminal, and no `process.exit()`
  was introduced. Both native workflow families now run the lifecycle contract.
- Does not prove: actual Windows ConPTY handle release, prompt bundled child-process exit, exact-head
  Node 24 behavior, artifact retention, clean-rebuild identity, native trust, oldest baseline, SSH,
  or any enabled tuple. Both Windows per-tuple cells remain unchecked.
- Checklist items satisfied: local green half of the PTY smoke-settlement correction and its
  purpose-named verification-command inventory only.
- Follow-up: commit and push the isolated correction, run both target-native Windows jobs at the
  exact head, and require normal smoke completion plus artifact upload before advancing.

  duration 155,781.418 ms. Upload remained skipped.
- Oracle proved: disposing all public PTY subscriptions and calling public Windows terminal cleanup
  after validated exit does not by itself settle the bundled child. The failure remains post-smoke
  and is not a PTY/watcher functional failure, but the retained resource type is still unknown.
- Does not prove: which PTY worker/socket, watcher, stdio, timer, or other resource remains; safe
  dependency-level remediation; normal child exit; artifact retention; or any tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: none beyond a new native red boundary; Windows rows remain unchecked.
- Follow-up: emit bounded `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` data after all smoke cleanup, retain it
  through the existing parent diagnostic, and make no further cleanup change until the resource
  class is visible on native Windows.

- Result: PASS. The resource/PTY/workflow slice passed 6/6 tests in 173 ms; all nine artifact
  suites passed 27/27 tests in 297 ms. Typecheck, focused oxlint, max-lines, full
  lint/reliability/localization, formatting, and whitespace gates passed with only existing
  out-of-package lint warnings.
- Oracle proved: Windows diagnostics use the public `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` API, retain
  only at most 256 resource type strings capped at 128 characters, report omitted counts, and take
  snapshots immediately after all functional cleanup and after a two-second drain window. POSIX
  smoke receives neither the delay nor a resource probe. Both native workflow families run the
  contract.
- Does not prove: the actual retained native Windows resource types, whether the culprit is PTY or
  watcher state, safe cleanup, normal child exit, artifact retention, or any tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: bounded local diagnostic contract and verification-command inventory
  only; no behavior, matrix, or tuple item.
- Follow-up: commit and push the diagnostic, capture both native Windows snapshots through the
  existing 45-second failure formatter, then change only the resource owner identified by evidence.

  ```

- Result: expected discriminating FAIL on both Windows jobs after 27/27 contract tests, exact signed
  inputs, offline native compilation, archive/tree inspection, and valid functional smoke output.
  Immediately after smoke each child reported three `PipeWrap` resources plus one `MessagePort`;
  after the two-second observation window one `PipeWrap` settled but the `MessagePort` remained.
  Each child then remained alive until the unchanged 45-second parent timeout sent `SIGTERM`.
- X64 metrics: functional smoke completed in 5,368.1555 ms with 60,022,784-byte RSS. The ZIP was
  37,212,066 bytes with content ID

  duration 169,800.5025 ms.
- POSIX control: Linux x64/arm64 and macOS x64/arm64 jobs at the same exact head all completed
  successfully; the Windows-only observation did not add a POSIX delay or resource probe.
- Oracle proved: the retained native resource class is one persistent `MessagePort` on both Windows
  architectures after successful PTY/ConPTY/watcher behavior and public PTY cleanup. The remaining
  `PipeWrap` resources are the smoke child's parent stdio and are not sufficient to explain the
  Windows-only non-exit because the same child-process boundary exits on POSIX.
- Does not prove: which dependency object owns the `MessagePort`, a safe correction, normal Windows
  child exit, uploaded artifact retention, clean-rebuild identity, native trust, SSH, or any tuple.
  Both Windows executable cells remain unchecked.
- Checklist items satisfied: native resource classification only.
- Follow-up: inspect the copied node-pty ConPTY worker lifecycle, add an exact-source fail-closed
  transform contract scoped to Windows artifact staging, then require both native jobs to exit and
  upload unpublished evidence before advancing.

- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0. Node 24 and native Windows remain the
  authoritative artifact environments.
- Remote and transport: none; synthetic copied-source fixtures only
- Exact command:
  `pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-pty-windows-settlement.test.mjs`
- Result: expected discriminating FAIL, 4/4 tests failed in 136 ms. The copied Windows source was
  unchanged, POSIX returned no explicit no-op result, and missing/duplicate source patterns did not
  fail closed.
- Oracle proved: the new contract failed for each missing behavior before the correction existed.
- Does not prove: the green transform, production wiring, native Windows execution, prompt worker
  settlement, or any tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the copied ConPTY worker settlement correction only.
- Follow-up: implement the exact one-match transform against exclusive artifact staging and rerun
  focused, artifact, and repository gates.

- Result: PASS. The purpose-named suite passed 5/5 tests in 124 ms; the settlement/PTY/resource/tree/
  workflow slice passed 12/12 tests across five suites in 201 ms; all ten artifact suites passed
  32/32 tests in 378 ms. Typecheck, focused oxlint, max-lines, full lint/reliability/localization,
  formatting, and whitespace gates passed with only existing out-of-package lint warnings.
- Duration and resource metrics: the combined repository static command completed in approximately
  12.4 seconds. Peak memory and open-file counts were not instrumented by these local static tests.
- Oracle proved: the transform accepts the exact pinned installed node-pty source, starts the
  ConPTY `Worker` drain even when no later output arrives, preserves later-data timer resets, modifies
  only the copied Windows artifact source after exclusive staging, and does not inspect a POSIX copy.
  Missing, drifted, duplicate, or already-transformed source rejects before a write. Both native
  workflow families run the purpose-named contract. The repository-wide
  `config/patches/node-pty@1.1.0.patch` and legacy/default desktop node-pty behavior are unchanged.
- Does not prove: native Windows worker termination, normal smoke child exit, absence of a persistent
  `MessagePort`, artifact upload, reproducibility, native trust, oldest baseline, SSH, or any tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: purpose-named local copied-source settlement contract and verification
  command inventory only; Windows executable rows remain unchecked.
- Follow-up: push the exact head and require both target-native Windows jobs to exit normally, show
  no persistent `MessagePort` after the observation window, and upload unpublished evidence.

  PTY/watcher behavior and the four POSIX controls. The exact uploaded evidence contains the runtime
  ZIP, identity, SPDX SBOM, and provenance files.

  A second clean `createSshRelayRuntimeArchive` invocation used the same runtime tree,
  `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, container digest, Node tar implementation, and XZ 5.4.1, followed by `cmp`
  and `sha256sum` against the first archive.

- Result: PASS. The target-native build authenticated the official Node metadata/archive, inspected
  5,774 upstream tar entries before selective extraction, executed Node v24.18.0, source-built
  Orca-patched `node-pty@1.1.0` against the exact Node 24 headers, stripped the resulting Linux
  addon, copied exactly one Linux arm64 glibc watcher native package, and preserved the existing
  relay/watcher content hash. Full archive and unpacked-tree verification agreed on content ID
  `sha256:cf0acba7a8839d5ee422755562ce30ffa4433a663991054d0b5d9681ebc54832`.
  The bundled runtime produced PTY input, 101×37 resize, and exit code 23 plus watcher create,
  update, rename-as-delete/create, and delete events. The same tree repacked byte-for-byte
  identically: both archives hashed to
  `sha256:b1b9857a42d45a068f03f2484f98fcebe82b3d21ddd53eac7d0bdabf494a7f9e`.
- Duration and resource metrics: exclusive artifact staging to finalized identity took 138.666
  seconds based on output birth/finalization timestamps; deterministic repack compression took
  approximately 109 seconds; full archive/tree/native verification took 3,746.221 ms; bundled
  PTY/watcher smoke took 248.879 ms with 35,328,000-byte RSS. The archive is 28,192,132 bytes,
  expands to 122,865,156 bytes, and contains 34 files/49 total entries. Build peak memory, open-file
  count, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented and remain CI follow-ups. After adding
  bounded native-command/xz execution, compressed-size prechecks, exact mode verification, frozen
  installs, and automatic parent creation, a fresh build into the previously absent
  `/evidence/new-parent/artifact` completed in 89,580.560 ms and retained the exact content/archive
  hashes above; verification took 3,515.039 ms and smoke took 192.609 ms with 34,885,632-byte RSS.

- Oracle proved: one native Linux arm64 glibc artifact-only build; exact official Node signature and

- Does not prove: GitHub runner reproducibility, Linux x64, macOS, Windows/zip, musl, oldest glibc or
  kernel, native code signing/trust, quarantine/Gatekeeper/WDAC/AV, SSH/SFTP/system-SSH transfer,
  relay RPC conformance, cancellation/file-handle/peak-memory budgets, release publication, cache,

  approved oldest-baseline or cross-family remote cell. The verified official Node binary reports
  upstream debug metadata and was intentionally preserved byte-for-byte; only Orca-built
  `pty.node` was stripped. Both plan artifacts now state that precedence explicitly.
- Checklist items satisfied: named assembly script; POSIX deterministic archive; pre-archive mode
  verification; local POSIX archive/smoke commands; Linux arm64 build/provenance, bundled Node,
  patched real PTY, and watcher cells only.
- Follow-up: run `.github/workflows/ssh-relay-runtime-artifacts.yml` on the exact draft-PR head,
  record resolved runner image identities and artifacts, implement Windows zip/native assembly
  separately, and leave every tuple disabled until oldest-baseline, trust, and both live SSH layers
  are complete.

### E-M3-STATIC-001 — Work Package 2 focused and repository static gates

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: implementation commit `f2b387b21bbe6a3863ff1a492a1a03b65e0a0477` in stacked
  draft PR [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741); native PR CI pending
- Runner: macOS 26.2 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0
- Remote and transport: not applicable; local source/static verification only
- Exact commands:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-release-verification.test.mjs \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-tar-inspection.test.mjs \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-artifact.test.mjs \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-workflow.test.mjs
  pnpm run typecheck
  pnpm run lint
  pnpm exec oxfmt --check .github/workflows/ssh-relay-runtime-artifacts.yml \
    config/scripts/*ssh-relay* config/ssh-relay-node-release-v24.18.0.json
  pnpm run check:max-lines-ratchet
  git diff --check
  ```

- Result: PASS. Four focused suites passed 15/15 tests in 993 ms; typecheck passed; repository lint
  passed with only pre-existing warnings outside Work Package 2; formatting passed for 20 matched
  files; max-lines reported 355 grandfathered suppressions and no new bypass; diff check passed.
- Duration and resource metrics: full lint completed in 20.438 seconds. Peak memory, open files, and
  cancellation settlement were not instrumented by these static commands.
- Artifact/log/trace link: purpose-named tests and local command output; durable GitHub job links are
  pending the draft PR.
- Oracle proved: hostile release-input/archive cases, canonical identity parity, deterministic
  archive/exact-tree and permission rejection, workflow runner/action/no-publication/frozen-install
  contracts, compilation, repository lint policy, formatting, line budget, and whitespace safety.
- Does not prove: Node 24 source-tool execution, target-native runners beyond E-M3-RUNTIME-LOCAL-001,
  macOS/x64, signing/trust, oldest baselines, SSH transfer, relay RPCs, publication, cancellation
  settlement, or any enabled tuple. The exact workflow head and Node 24 gates require PR CI.
- Checklist items satisfied: current Work Package 2 local handoff/static gate only.
- Follow-up: create the isolated stacked draft PR, run the four target-native POSIX jobs, and replace
  uncommitted/local evidence with exact commit, run, job, image, artifact, and duration identifiers.

### E-M3-CI-RED-001 — Native macOS watcher path-oracle failure

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: exact draft-PR head `f8a230ef301fc6f2bb76082f549e3b3ae725c142` in
  [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Runner and jobs: GitHub Actions run
  [29335018198](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29335018198); macOS arm64 job
  [87092056703](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29335018198/job/87092056703) used
  `macos-15-arm64` image `20260706.0213.1`, macOS 15.7.7, runner arm64, and Node v24.18.0;
  macOS x64 job
  [87092056769](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29335018198/job/87092056769) used
  `macos-15` image `20260629.0276.1`, runner x64, and Node v24.18.0
- Remote and transport: no SSH remote; target-native artifact build and local execution on each
  hosted runner; Node inputs downloaded from the exact pinned nodejs.org URLs
- Exact workflow/log commands:

  ```sh
  gh run watch 29335018198 --repo stablyai/orca --exit-status --interval 10
  gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
    repos/stablyai/orca/actions/jobs/87092056703/logs
  gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
    repos/stablyai/orca/actions/jobs/87092056769/logs
  ```

- Result: expected discriminating FAIL. Both macOS jobs passed exact-head checkout, Node 24 setup,
  frozen dependency install, 15/15 contract tests, authenticated Node input download, target-native
  Node/`node-pty`/watcher assembly, deterministic archive inspection, and full tree hashing. Native
  smoke then timed out after 15 seconds waiting for watcher `create`; evidence upload correctly did
  not run. Both Linux jobs completed build, verification, smoke, and unpublished upload, but their
  cells remain provisional until the corrected exact-head matrix reruns.
- Duration and resource metrics: macOS arm64 job failed in 1m51s after a 54,699.324 ms artifact
  build; macOS x64 failed in 3m44s after a 105,665.482 ms artifact build. Each watcher wait settled
  at its declared 15-second bound. Peak memory and open-file counts were not recorded in the failed
  macOS smoke because no success payload was emitted.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run and job links above. The arm64 pre-smoke artifact had content ID
  `sha256:cc205af32168718f9662e8513338ad844ba4c1210c247623d84f92778afa1610` and archive hash
  `sha256:cd9cca6f56c9645a73b6b022515668ef7392c2eeb8f01d63b8a46b046cf337a3`;
  the x64 pre-smoke artifact had content ID
  `sha256:82a7017f6c1f703258a9d6b9f3d5ad4d5c57320f1b667fd87902cb1f4cd21cd3` and archive hash

- Oracle proved: the native matrix and exact-head provenance gates discriminate after successful
  builds; macOS FSEvents can report canonical `/private/var/...` paths while `tmpdir()` supplied the
  `/var/...` symlink spelling, so the equality oracle could reject the same filesystem object.
- Does not prove: a passing macOS watcher, upload, native trust/signing, oldest baseline, SSH,
  relay RPCs, Windows, or any enabled tuple. Successful Linux results from this failed aggregate do
  not satisfy the final corrected-head evidence requirement.
- Checklist items satisfied: red half of the macOS target-native watcher-smoke gate only; no tuple
  checkbox was changed.
- Follow-up: canonicalize the watched temporary directory before constructing expected event paths,
  retain bounded observed-event diagnostics, rerun all four jobs, and require every upload to pass.

- Result: PASS. All four jobs checked out the exact source head, used Node v24.18.0, authenticated
  the pinned Node release metadata and tuple archive, used a frozen source install, passed 15/15
  focused contracts, assembled on the target-native architecture, verified the complete archive and
  unpacked tree before native execution, loaded the Orca-patched PTY addon, exercised a real PTY
  input/101×37 resize/exit-23 lifecycle, observed bounded create/update/rename/delete watcher events,
  and uploaded only an unpublished seven-day Actions artifact.
- Oracle proved: target-native build/provenance, bundled Node execution, patched native PTY load and
  lifecycle, watcher lifecycle, exact archive/tree equality, size bounds, and artifact-only workflow
  behavior for the four named POSIX tuples on the exact runner images above.
- Does not prove: deterministic native rebuilding. The local versus CI Linux arm64 runtime differed
  in the Orca-built `pty.node`, and the red versus corrected macOS runs produced different content
  identities despite no intended runtime-tree source change. The current jobs record image and
  toolchain versions but do not pin all apt/Homebrew/compiler inputs or compare two clean native
  builds on the same runner. This evidence also does not prove oldest OS/libc/kernel baselines,
  native signing/trust, Windows/ZIP, musl, SSH/SFTP/system-SSH transfer, relay RPC conformance,
  cancellation/file/channel peaks, release publication/read-back, cache, fallback, UI, or any
  enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: build/provenance, bundled Node, real patched PTY, and watcher cells for
  `linux-x64-glibc`, `linux-arm64-glibc`, `darwin-x64`, and `darwin-arm64` only. Oldest-baseline and
  native-trust cells remain unchecked.
- Follow-up: add a same-head/same-runner two-clean-build identity comparison, implement bounded
  deterministic Windows ZIP assembly and native Windows jobs, and leave all tuples disabled until
  the remaining trust, baseline, and two-layer live SSH gates pass.

- Result: PASS. The purpose-named comparator/workflow command passed 10/10 tests in 200 ms; the
  complete artifact set passed 40/40 tests across 11 suites in 1.09 seconds. Typecheck, focused
  oxlint, the 355-entry max-lines ratchet, full repository lint/reliability/localization, formatting,
  and exact-commit diff checks all exited zero. Full lint emitted only pre-existing warnings outside
  this package.
- Duration and resource metrics: purpose suite 0.87 seconds wall; full artifact suite 3.02 seconds;
  typecheck 8.47 seconds; focused oxlint 1.94 seconds; max-lines 4.95 seconds; full lint 26.34 seconds;
  formatting 5.56 seconds; diff check 90 ms. Comparator file reads are incremental, bounded to 250
  MiB per file and 500 MiB per output, with 6,000 entries, 512-byte paths, depth 40, a five-minute
  AbortSignal, and sequential tree walks. Peak RSS/open files were not instrumented for synthetic
  fixtures; native CI remains responsible for real artifact duration and size evidence.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact source and test files in commit `c70e96374`; durable target-native
  run and job links pending
- Oracle proved: distinct real output roots are required; symlinks and special files reject before
  hashing; complete runtime/archive/identity/SPDX/provenance output is mandatory; archive bytes must
  match their identity; any path type, mode, size, or SHA-256 drift fails closed. Both POSIX and
  Windows jobs build and independently verify/smoke two exclusive outputs, compare only afterward,
  and copy/upload only the first verified equal output. The workflow retains read-only permissions,
  exact-head checkout, SHA-pinned actions, explicit runner labels, and no release publication path.
- Does not prove: any real native build is reproducible, Node v24 execution, compiler/linker
  determinism, Linux/macOS/Windows output equality, oldest baselines, native trust/signing, SSH,
  publication, transfer, cache, fallback, UI, or an enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: purpose-named local reproducibility/workflow command and exact-commit
  static handoff only; no per-tuple or native-trust checkbox changes.
- Follow-up: push the exact head, run all six native jobs, and record the exact differing path/field
  for every red result before correcting producer nondeterminism without weakening this oracle.

  26,384,576 bytes. The committed comparator first reported identity SHA-256 drift on both macOS
  architectures. Windows x64 and arm64 stopped before downloading Node inputs or building artifacts
  because Vitest collected zero comparator tests with `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`;
  the other 10 suites passed with 31 tests passed and one skipped.
- Duration and resource metrics: Linux build/compare steps completed in 125 seconds (x64) and 131
  seconds (arm64); macOS arm64 failed after 123 seconds in the build/compare step. Windows contract
  suites completed in 1.54 seconds on arm64 and before artifact assembly on both architectures.
  Peak RSS, file/channel counts, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented by this gate.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run and job links above. The two Linux evidence artifacts are unpublished;
  failed cells uploaded no runtime artifact.
- Oracle proved: the equality gate accepts both Linux glibc tuples and detects real macOS
  clean-build drift; Windows contract collection fails before unverified artifact work can start.
  No asset was published and no production or default path changed.
- Does not prove: Windows parser correction, macOS producer determinism, oldest baselines, native
  trust/signing, SSH, SFTP/system-SSH, release publication, resolver/cache,
  transfer/install, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: none newly complete; native reproducibility remains open.
- Follow-up: remove the comparator shebang, add explicit native `node --check` gates, report
  runtime-tree drift before derived metadata, rerun all six jobs, and correct the macOS producer only
  after the exact differing runtime file is identified. Never ignore or normalize unequal bytes in
  the comparator.

- Result: PASS. Both new files passed `node --check`; the purpose suite passed 11/11 tests; the
  complete artifact set passed 41/41 tests across 11 suites. Typecheck, focused oxlint, the
  355-entry max-lines ratchet, full repository lint/reliability/localization, formatting, and diff
  checks exited zero. Full lint emitted only pre-existing warnings outside this package.
- Duration and resource metrics: syntax checks 60 ms and 50 ms; purpose suite 850 ms wall; complete
  artifact suite 1.27 seconds wall; typecheck 2.00 seconds; focused oxlint 480 ms; max-lines 780 ms;
  full lint 11.96 seconds. Synthetic fixture peak RSS/open files were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact sources in commit `e58913d1a`; target-native rerun pending
- Oracle proved: the comparator and its test import parse locally without the shebang; both POSIX
  and Windows workflow contract stages run explicit syntax checks before Vitest or artifact inputs;
  a simultaneous runtime/identity drift reports the runtime-tree path first. The comparator still
  compares every byte and does not normalize or ignore drift.
- Does not prove: Windows x64/arm64 parsing, any native build, the differing macOS runtime path,
  macOS determinism, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or an
  enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: no native or tuple box; this closes only the local diagnostic
  correction required after E-M3-REPRODUCIBILITY-CI-RED-001.
- Follow-up: push the exact commit, rerun all six native jobs, require both Windows syntax checks to
  pass, and use the macOS runtime-first failure path to correct producer nondeterminism.

- Result: FAIL as an evidence-producing native gate. Every POSIX runner passed 41/41 contracts;
  Windows passed 38 and skipped three POSIX-only tests. Linux x64 and arm64 built, verified,
  smoked, compared exactly, and uploaded unpublished artifacts `8317161547` and `8317164595`.
  macOS arm64 first differed at
  `runtime/node_modules/node-pty/build/Release/pty.node`, with content IDs
  `sha256:206de506d0499ded3c16913e28f76c528f5bead5214e6675ee4a5ee6bb0a642c` and

  macOS x64 differed at the same path with
  `sha256:eda4590b97d003f9a94fb59595a84273f3660fb920d85ff699c9d7925c52a7a2` and

- Duration and resource metrics: build/compare steps were 138 seconds for Linux x64, 132 seconds
  for Linux arm64, 100 seconds for macOS arm64, 301 seconds for macOS x64, 296 seconds for Windows
  x64, and 285 seconds for Windows arm64. Both builds in every failing cell completed bundled
  Node/native PTY/watcher smoke before comparison. Smoke RSS ranged from 40,615,936 to 53,633,024
  bytes in failing cells. Peak build RSS, open files/channels, and cancellation settlement were not
  instrumented by this gate.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/job links above; Linux x64 upload
  [8317161547](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29348424235/artifacts/8317161547) and
  Linux arm64 upload
  [8317164595](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29348424235/artifacts/8317164595);
  failing cells correctly uploaded nothing
- Oracle proved: the parser and runtime-first diagnostic corrections execute on all native runner
  families; Linux reproducibility remains green; macOS and Windows drift is inside native node-pty
  outputs rather than archive/identity derivation; rejected cells cannot upload or publish bytes.
- Does not prove: either linker correction, macOS/Windows equality, cross-run identity, oldest
  baselines, native trust/signing, SSH, transfer, publication, resolver/cache, fallback, UI, or an
  enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: no new completion checkbox; this closes only the diagnostic run and
  identifies the bounded producer corrections required next.
- Follow-up: retain the complete-output comparator, correct native producers without post-build
  normalization, and require a new same-head six-runner pass before advancing.

  The native oracle downloaded `node-v24.18.0-darwin-arm64.tar.xz`, twice extracted it under the
  fixed exclusive `/tmp/orca-ssh-relay-runtime-build-work/node-inputs` path, called
  `buildPatchedSshRelayNodePty` twice with the same clean `node-pty` path, compared both outputs,
  required one `LC_UUID` from `otool -l`, and then repeated the build in a separate process session
  against the prior hashes.

- Result: PASS locally. The focused command passed 8/8 tests; all 14 artifact suites passed 47/47.
  Typecheck, focused oxlint, the 355-entry max-lines ratchet, full repository
  lint/reliability/localization, formatting, syntax, and diff gates exited zero. Full lint emitted
  only pre-existing out-of-package warnings. Two clean native passes and the separate repeat session
  produced byte-identical outputs: `pty.node` was 83,256 bytes with SHA-256
  `e73f80560b8ecc0ae19421fc82fb612e4f50e66f17dfd491cdf95599bc7b685a`, and
  `spawn-helper` was 50,192 bytes with SHA-256
  `3396961b0f8f9cdb0fcd2155eb54035276ee7ee2813d84faa1dfae5ba84dc95d`.
  Each retained exactly one `LC_UUID`, and every `buildPatchedSshRelayNodePty` call completed its
  bundled-Node native-load oracle. A separate `-Wl,-no_uuid` diagnostic made bytes equal but caused
  bundled Node/dlopen to reject `pty.node` with `missing LC_UUID load command`; that approach was
  discarded and is not present in the implementation.
- Duration and resource metrics: focused tests 229 ms; exact-head full artifact suite 1.35 seconds;
  parallel static gate 11.5 seconds; two-pass canonical native harness 11.126 seconds; separate
  repeat native build 2.511 seconds excluding archive download/extraction. Native harness peak RSS,
  file counts, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact source commits and local command output; no artifact was published
- Oracle proved: output/work overlap rejects; both paths are exclusive; a caller-provided canonical
  work path is reused cleanly and safely; macOS configures then links with `-Wl,-reproducible`
  without deleting `LC_UUID`; copied Windows `binding.gyp` receives exactly one `/Brepro` and source
  drift fails closed; Linux and legacy/repository-wide node-pty behavior are unchanged; both native
  workflow families use the same canonical runner-local path while retaining run-scoped outputs.
- Does not prove: native Windows `/Brepro` behavior, macOS x64, GitHub-hosted equality, different
  runner-image/toolchain revisions, oldest baselines, native signatures/trust, SSH, transfer,
  publication, resolver/cache, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: exact-head local linker/work-path contracts and macOS arm64 native
  correction only; native reproducibility remains open until all six jobs pass together.
- Follow-up: push `3e433b343`, run all six target-native jobs, and require complete equality plus
  upload in each cell without weakening the comparator.

- Result: FAIL as an evidence-producing six-runner gate. Linux x64/arm64 and macOS x64/arm64 each
  passed 47/47 contracts, authenticated exact Node inputs, performed two exclusive native builds,
  fully inspected and smoked both outputs, compared the runtime tree/archive/identity/SPDX/
  provenance byte-for-byte, and uploaded only the first equal output. Windows x64/arm64 each passed
  42 tests and skipped three POSIX-only tests across 13 suites, then failed while collecting
  `ssh-relay-runtime-build.test.mjs` with `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`: that test
  imports `build-ssh-relay-runtime.mjs`, whose first line was an unused Unix shebang. Input download,
  native build, verification, comparison, and upload were all skipped on both Windows jobs.

- Duration and resource metrics: total jobs were 3m12s Linux x64, 3m28s Linux arm64, 2m50s macOS
  arm64, 4m28s macOS x64, 1m19s Windows x64, and 3m42s Windows arm64. Windows contract collection
  took 1.97s and 2.76s. POSIX comparison scanned 54/55 entries and 146.8–154.1 MB in 285–895 ms.
  Build peak RSS, open files/channels, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/job links and four unpublished seven-day artifacts above; Windows
  correctly produced no artifact
- Oracle proved: the canonical clean-work directory plus `-Wl,-reproducible` makes both native
  macOS architectures byte-identical while retaining successful bundled-Node/native PTY/watcher
  execution; both Linux controls remain equal; failed contract collection prevents Windows inputs,
  execution, and upload. The parser boundary is the imported builder shebang, not `/Brepro` output.
- Does not prove: Windows builder parsing after correction, native `/Brepro` equality, a six-job
  pass, cross-run identity, oldest baselines, native trust/signing, SSH, transfer, publication,
  resolver/cache, fallback, UI, or an enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native macOS linker reproducibility evidence only; native
  reproducibility remains open until all six same-head jobs pass together.
- Follow-up: remove only the unused builder shebang, syntax-check the builder and its test on POSIX
  and Windows before Vitest, rerun local gates, then require a new six-runner exact-head pass.

- Result: PASS at the exact implementation commit. Both syntax checks exited zero; all 14 artifact
  suites passed 47/47 tests. Typecheck, focused oxlint, the 355-entry max-lines ratchet, full
  repository lint/reliability/localization, formatting, and exact-head diff checks exited zero.
  Full lint emitted only pre-existing warnings outside this package.
- Duration and resource metrics: full artifact command 3.08s wall; typecheck 3.30s; focused oxlint
  0.49s; max-lines 0.76s; full lint 12.79s. Synthetic test peak RSS, open files/channels, and
  cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact commit and local command output; no runtime artifact was produced
- Oracle proved: the builder and importing test parse after removing only the unused shebang; every
  real builder invocation remains explicitly through `node`; both workflow families syntax-check
  the builder and test before Vitest or Node input download; workflow source contracts require both
  POSIX and Windows checks without changing permissions, artifact scope, or production behavior.
- Does not prove: native Windows parsing, Node 24 behavior, `/Brepro` output equality, any native
  build, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, transfer, publication, resolver/cache, fallback, UI,
  or an enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: exact local builder parser/syntax-gate correction only; no native or
  tuple checkbox.
- Follow-up: push the exact commit and require all six target-native jobs to pass together before
  closing native reproducibility.

- Result: FAIL as a six-runner reproducibility gate. All six jobs passed the builder/test syntax
  checks and artifact contracts, authenticated the exact Node inputs, and completed two native
  builds. Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64 inspected and smoked both outputs,
  compared every runtime/archive/identity/SPDX/provenance entry exactly, and uploaded only after
  equality. Windows arm64 also inspected and smoked both complete 60-entry, 42-file, 86,189,895-byte
  outputs, including PTY input/resize/exit, watcher lifecycle, and resource settlement, but the
  comparator first found SHA-256 drift at
  `runtime/node_modules/node-pty/build/Release/conpty_console_list.node`; no arm64 artifact uploaded.
- Equal-output artifacts: Linux x64 `8318426445` (29,283,624 bytes), Linux arm64 `8318449064`
  (28,212,246 bytes), macOS arm64 `8318457230` (24,710,997 bytes), Windows x64 `8318478579`
  (37,075,312 bytes), and macOS x64 `8318524353` (26,365,330 bytes), all unpublished seven-day
  Actions artifacts. Their runtime content IDs are respectively `960546cd96c6`, `aa3aa8ae8b42`,

  4m7s macOS arm64, 6m34s macOS x64, and 10m37s Windows arm64. Windows arm64 native builds took
  152,711 ms and 132,480 ms; smoke took 5,845 ms and 5,408 ms at 53,018,624 and 51,732,480 bytes
  RSS. Build peak RSS, open files/channels, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Oracle proved: the parser correction works natively on both Windows architectures; `/Brepro`
  yields complete equality on Windows x64; all four POSIX controls remain equal; a native arm64
  residual is isolated to the copied node-pty `conpty_console_list.node`; mismatch prevents upload.
- Does not prove: the differing byte region or PE field, a Windows arm64 correction, all-six
  equality, cross-run identity, oldest baselines, native trust/signing, SSH, transfer, publication,
  resolver/cache, fallback, UI, or an enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native parser boundary and five same-head reproducibility cells only;
  native reproducibility remains open.
- Follow-up: add a bounded PE-diff diagnostic for the two Windows arm64 binaries, record byte ranges
  and headers, then correct only the copied artifact build if evidence identifies a safe source.
  Do not weaken comparison, upload failed outputs, or change repository-wide/legacy node-pty.

- Result: FAIL as expected at the unchanged native boundary. All 14 contract suites passed on
  Windows arm64 with 44 tests passed and three POSIX-only skips. Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64,
  and Windows x64 independently built twice, inspected, smoked, compared exactly, and uploaded
  unpublished artifacts `8318818618`, `8318833832`, `8318812505`, `8318846378`, and `8318866333`.
  Windows arm64 again built, inspected, and smoked two complete 60-entry, 42-file,
  86,189,895-byte outputs, then first differed at
  `runtime/node_modules/node-pty/build/Release/conpty_console_list.node`; upload was skipped.
- Windows arm64 rejected outputs: first content ID

  RSS. Build peak RSS, open files/channels, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/job above and the five unpublished seven-day artifacts; no failed
  arm64 bytes were uploaded
- Oracle proved: the Windows arm64 difference repeats across an independent run while the same-head
  Windows x64 and four POSIX controls remain reproducible; the strict gate consistently prevents a
  rejected output from upload. The drift is not a transient failure from run 29351557922.
- Does not prove: differing PE byte ranges/headers, a producer correction, arm64 equality,
  cross-run equality, oldest baselines, native trust/signing, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback,
  UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: no new completion checkbox; this repeat evidence justifies the bounded
  PE diagnostic before any producer change.
- Follow-up: run the bounded diagnostic on both native Windows runners, require x64 to remain equal,
  and use only the rejected arm64 headers/ranges to choose or reject a copied-artifact correction.

- Result: PASS at the exact implementation commit. Both syntax checks exited zero; the purpose
  command passed 5/5 tests across two suites; all 15 artifact suites passed 50/50 tests. Typecheck,
  focused oxlint, the 355-entry max-lines ratchet, full repository
  lint/reliability/localization, formatting, staged hooks, and diff checks exited zero. Full lint
  emitted only pre-existing warnings outside this package.
- Duration and resource metrics: syntax checks 50 ms and 40 ms; purpose suite 142 ms Vitest / 0.76s
  wall; complete artifact suite 470 ms Vitest / 1.15s wall; typecheck 2.68s; focused oxlint 0.69s;
  max-lines 1.58s; full lint 11.92s; formatting check 1.82s. The implementation rejects inputs over
  64 MiB, reads in 64 KiB chunks, caps the header at 1 MiB, the section/debug tables at 96/32
  entries, byte/header differences at 128 each, and the whole diagnostic at 60 seconds. Synthetic
  peak RSS/open files were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact source commit; no binary artifact was created or uploaded
- Oracle proved: valid PE32+ fixtures report whole-file sizes/SHA-256, coalesced file-offset ranges,
  COFF/optional/data-directory/section/debug headers, and hashed—not printed—CodeView paths;
  oversized, malformed, same-file, unknown-argument, and pre-aborted inputs fail boundedly. Workflow
  contracts require diagnostic syntax/tests on Windows, invoke it only after the strict comparator
  rejects the two retained `conpty_console_list.node` files, throw afterward, and leave evidence
  copying unreachable, so rejected binaries are not uploaded. No max-lines bypass was added.
- Does not prove: parsing the real x64/arm64 linker outputs, native Node 24 behavior, the actual
  differing ranges/headers, x64 equality after the workflow change, a producer correction, arm64
  equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or an enabled
  tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: local bounded diagnostic and fail-closed workflow ordering only; no
  native, tuple, or production checkbox.
- Follow-up: push the exact implementation, require native x64 equality and arm64 diagnostic output
  with no upload, then record the exact PE evidence before changing the producer.

  `87155072849`
- Runners: the six target-native labels recorded in prior reproducibility evidence. The diagnostic
  cell was Windows 11 Enterprise 10.0.26200 arm64, image `windows-11-arm64` `20260706.102.1`,
  runner `2.335.1`, provisioner `20260624.560`, Node v24.18.0, MSVC 19.44.35228 / tools
  14.44.35207, Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0, and Python 3.13.14.
- Remote and transport: none; target-native artifact assembly/execution, rejected-file diagnostics,
  and unpublished Actions artifact upload only
- Exact evidence commands:

  gh api 'repos/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29353432240/artifacts?per_page=100'
  ```

- Result: FAIL as the intended evidence-producing gate. Both Windows jobs passed 15 suites with 47
  tests passed and three POSIX-only skips, including native Node 24 execution of the new diagnostic
  contracts. Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64 built twice, inspected, smoked,
  compared exactly, and uploaded unpublished artifacts `8319201464`, `8319207054`, `8319191783`,
  `8319227039`, and `8319248077`. Windows x64 therefore proves the diagnostic package does not
  disturb the successful comparator/upload path. Windows arm64 again built, inspected, and smoked
  both complete outputs, then failed at `conpty_console_list.node`; the diagnostic ran before the
  fatal throw and artifact upload was skipped.
- Rejected arm64 runtime outputs: first content ID
  `bb05f852159277dea617679f84304d2bc3b01d446ceffd07fb58c9469038bcf6`, ZIP 33,261,545 bytes
  with SHA-256 `248a4962141e5b1b1c5b24433993923171c5c1d342b8db4de624b92a1019823c`;

  `24f752754890704e991f5cc85663a6bb7a6934fc5d64f81ea2414ea12778c249`.
- PE diagnostic result: both native modules are exactly 956,928 bytes with identical machine
  `0xaa64`, 12-section layout, PE32+ image/section/file alignment, 840,192-byte code section,
  data directories, load config, imports, relocations, and linker version 14.44. Their SHA-256 values
  are `7ef783c59d73cd6101fbed4ef634ef3d075448726c118b36cca4d17145e35afa` and
  `196dc3373e52350abdf33c30f80a00e0b9b71c96b53b47ba337b1abe428ac8fc`.
  Exactly 2,946 bytes differ across 2,887 coalesced ranges. The first code difference is at file
  offset `0x41c`, followed by one-byte ranges at 16-byte intervals in the retained sample. Header
  differences are confined to COFF/debug timestamps `dd34d0b3` versus `0211cbf1` and CodeView IDs
  `383b9420683f05ced18d65c8e95b4a72` versus `459643a06a5ac306094361fd1788cbe5`;
  CodeView age and the SHA-256 of the unprinted 92-byte PDB path are identical. The detailed-range
  list correctly reports truncation after 128 of 2,887 ranges.
- Duration and resource metrics: jobs were 8m48s Windows arm64, 4m12s macOS x64, 3m15s Linux x64,
  2m57s macOS arm64, 3m24s Linux arm64, and 5m0s Windows x64. Arm64 native builds took 148,290 ms
  and 120,068 ms; smoke took 5,871 ms and 5,421 ms at 51,417,088 and 52,633,600 bytes RSS. The PE
  diagnostic completed between log timestamps 17:30:23.088 and 17:30:23.272 UTC. Build peak RSS,
  open files/channels, and cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/job above and five unpublished seven-day artifacts; no rejected
  arm64 bytes were uploaded
- Oracle proved: native Windows parses and bounds the real PE files, x64 remains fully reproducible,
  arm64 output layout and PDB path are stable, and drift affects thousands of mostly single-byte
  code ranges plus `/Brepro`-derived identity fields rather than only a timestamp. The comparator
  and no-upload boundary remain strict.
- Does not prove: the full per-section distribution because the first diagnostic version labels raw
  section data as unmapped and caps detailed ranges at 128; the responsible compiler/linker input,
  a safe producer correction, arm64 equality, cross-run equality, oldest baselines, native trust,
  SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native PE diagnostic and Windows x64 control only; no tuple or
  production checkbox.
- Follow-up: add raw-section attribution plus bounded per-section totals/samples across the complete
  scan, rerun both Windows cells, and do not change the producer until that evidence is recorded.

- Result: PASS. Both syntax checks exited zero; the purpose command passed 6/6 tests across two
  suites; all 15 artifact suites passed 51/51 tests. Typecheck, focused oxlint, the 355-entry
  max-lines ratchet, full repository lint/reliability/localization, formatting, staged hooks, and
  diff checks exited zero. Full lint emitted only pre-existing warnings outside this package.
- Duration and resource metrics: purpose suite 246 ms Vitest; complete artifact suite 963 ms Vitest
  / 2.24s wall; typecheck 2.52s; focused oxlint 0.68s; max-lines 1.54s; full lint 11.09s; formatting
  and diff check 1.06s. The full scan still reads in 64 KiB chunks; detailed ranges remain capped at
  128, each byte excerpt at 32 bytes, each region at eight samples, and the entire diagnostic at 60
  seconds. Synthetic peak RSS/open files were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact source commit; no binary artifact was created or uploaded
- Oracle proved: every coalesced range contributes to bounded per-region differing-byte and range
  totals even after the detailed-range cap is exhausted; raw PE section data is attributed by the
  most specific overlapping region, preserving CodeView/debug labels; excerpts and region samples
  remain bounded. The comparator, fatal failure, and no-upload ordering are unchanged.
- Does not prove: the real arm64 section distribution, Windows x64 control, arm64 reproducibility,
  a producer correction, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI,
  or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: diagnostic observability only; no artifact, tuple, or production box.
- Follow-up: push the exact implementation and ledger head, run all six target-native cells, require
  five reproducible uploads plus a rejected Windows arm64 full-scan summary, and record that evidence
  before changing any copied-artifact producer input.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-PE-FULL-SCAN-CI-RED-001 — Complete native arm64 region classification

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: exact head `a51093f009a03a1105e9f0b86be14797a8046414`, containing exact
  diagnostic implementation `cd7f941365bf6e631cf0f9947f517ecef02afc8e`; stacked draft
  PR [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Run and jobs: [run 29354676731](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29354676731),
  conclusion `failure`; Windows arm64 `87159223395`, Linux arm64 `87159223407`, macOS x64
  `87159223419`, macOS arm64 `87159223455`, Windows x64 `87159223488`, and Linux x64
  `87159223544`
- Runners: the six target-native labels recorded in prior reproducibility evidence. The diagnostic
  cell was Windows 11 Enterprise 10.0.26200 arm64, image `windows-11-arm64` `20260706.102.1`,
  runner `2.335.1`, provisioner `20260624.560`, Node v24.18.0, MSVC 19.44.35228 / tools
  14.44.35207, Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0, and Python 3.13.14.
- Remote and transport: none; target-native artifact assembly/execution, rejected-file diagnostics,
  and unpublished Actions artifact upload only
- Exact evidence commands:

  ```sh
  gh run view 29354676731 --repo stablyai/orca \
    --json headSha,status,conclusion,url,createdAt,updatedAt,jobs
  gh api repos/stablyai/orca/actions/jobs/87159223395/logs
  gh api 'repos/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29354676731/artifacts?per_page=100'
  ```

- Result: FAIL as the intended evidence-producing gate. All Windows contract suites passed before
  execution; Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64 built twice, inspected, smoked,
  compared exactly, and uploaded. Windows arm64 built, inspected, and smoked both outputs, then the
  strict comparator rejected `conpty_console_list.node`; the full-scan diagnostic completed before
  the fatal throw and the upload step was skipped.
- Uploaded controls: `ssh-relay-runtime-linux-x64-glibc` artifact `8319697674` (29,282,973 bytes),
  Linux arm64 `8319710845` (28,211,514), macOS x64 `8319759300` (26,374,729), macOS arm64
  `8319686475` (24,756,958), and Windows x64 `8319797990` (37,075,313). All are unpublished and
  expire 2026-07-21; the run contains exactly five artifacts and no Windows arm64 artifact.
- Rejected arm64 outputs: content IDs
  `75f048e2216c5a88b5dec886d7ce43f8c54768c42184835cfd0d9a22ea3f1e53` and
  `dddc49d84bdafd5bef136be5050352555e99943b21f49781f1604bd9e37051bc`; ZIP sizes 33,261,549
  and 33,261,550 bytes with SHA-256
  `4c21eaba04e514dee246ee23ea6b4559369fc37eaf90dc0634f11146427bb45a` and
  `aecde9c9982d972d194417cc2d076353fb808f39ba4f018b8d9e64cfdf5c3411`.
- PE diagnostic result: both modules are 956,928-byte machine `0xaa64` PE32+ files with identical
  12-section layout, data directories, imports, relocations, 840,192-byte code section, and linker
  version 14.44. Their SHA-256 values are
  `52d4909f106a4e8f85e7fc4c8cc0ccae93eaa74a83342b569d71f67619f15a1e` and
  `6926210ec6208caa2a79655e2af544b74d8a0d6d1b8c7637d4ece017c89046de`. Exactly 2,947 bytes
  differ across 2,886 ranges:
  - `.text`: 2,879 one-byte ranges from file offsets 1,052 through 47,100, exactly 16 bytes apart;
    all eight retained samples change `85` to `0e`.
  - COFF header: one four-byte `/Brepro` timestamp range.
  - Debug directory: three four-byte ranges carrying that timestamp.
  - CodeView data: one 16-byte identifier range.
  - `.rdata`: two ranges totaling 36 bytes, containing the derived CodeView/build identities and
    timestamp.

  The CodeView path remains 92 bytes with identical SHA-256
  `401080e65f10d7483583537fc7394ddf416fa36febfd76e6d1c17c64bb36f3ea`; no other section
  differs. The detailed list remains capped while every range contributes to the five bounded region
  summaries.

- Duration and resource metrics: jobs were 9m50s Windows arm64, 6m56s Windows x64, 5m33s macOS x64,
  3m44s Linux arm64, 3m18s Linux x64, and 2m55s macOS arm64. Arm64 builds took 152,517 ms and
  130,926 ms; smoke took 5,963 ms and 5,414 ms at 51,884,032 and 51,789,824 bytes RSS. The complete
  smoke stages took 7,978 ms and 7,203 ms. Build peak RSS, open files/channels, and cancellation
  settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/jobs and five unpublished seven-day artifacts above; rejected arm64
  bytes remained runner-local
- Oracle proved: the arm64 failure is copied-source producer nondeterminism concentrated in a
  regular `.text` pattern, with only derived `/Brepro` identities elsewhere. It is not ZIP order,
  tree metadata, comparator normalization, a changing PDB path, or a cross-platform regression. The
  strict no-upload boundary remains effective.
- Does not prove: which compiler input causes the repeating `.text` byte, a safe producer
  correction, arm64 equality, cross-run equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication,
  transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: complete native PE region classification and five control cells only;
  no tuple or production checkbox.
- Follow-up: evaluate a test-covered reproducible compiler input only in the copied node-pty source,
  rerun all local gates and all six target-native cells, and require exact arm64 equality without
  normalizing binaries or weakening the comparator.

- Artifact/log/trace link: exact source commit; no binary artifact was created or uploaded
- Oracle proved: Windows builds receive `/Brepro` and `/experimental:deterministic` in both the
  compiler and linker option blocks after an exact reviewed-source match. POSIX tuples are untouched,
  unexpected or already-modified source fails closed, and the installed repository
  `node_modules/node-pty/binding.gyp` remains byte-identical because only the exclusive copied source

- Checklist items satisfied: copied-source compiler/linker input contract only; no tuple or

- Follow-up: push the exact implementation and ledger head, run all six target-native cells, and
  require exact equality and successful unpublished upload on both Windows architectures.

  ```

- Result: FAIL as the intended strict evidence gate. All 15 Windows contract suites passed with
  48 passing and three intentionally skipped tests. Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows
  x64 built twice, inspected, executed, compared exactly, and uploaded. Windows arm64 built and
  executed both complete outputs, then the comparator rejected
  `runtime/node_modules/node-pty/build/Release/conpty_console_list.node`; the diagnostic ran, the
  job failed, and no Windows arm64 artifact was uploaded.
- Uploaded controls: Linux x64 artifact `8320207112` (29,282,626 bytes), Linux arm64
  `8320217472` (28,211,075), macOS x64 `8320277866` (26,390,709), macOS arm64 `8320191810`
  (24,741,051), and Windows x64 `8320261436` (37,075,310). All are unpublished seven-day
  artifacts; the run contains exactly five artifacts.
- Rejected arm64 outputs: content IDs
  `5523ec111f63a53edb3da090cf90bedb0421c2c9862dc0356e106fdf5a6519f2` and

- PE diagnostic result: both rejected modules remain 956,928-byte machine `0xaa64` PE32+ files
  with the identical 12-section layout. Their SHA-256 values are
  `548ff529facca76eb3a30c79f96e2170336b7cf01a3e55aabc2a5cd615cd1111` and

  same 2,947 bytes differ across 2,886 ranges: 2,879 one-byte `.text` ranges every 16 bytes from
  offsets 1,052 through 47,100, plus 68 bytes of derived COFF/debug/CodeView identity. The retained
  `.text` samples all change `45` to `2d`; the 92-byte PDB path hash remains identical.
- Duration and resource metrics: jobs were 8m25s Windows arm64, 5m50s macOS x64, 5m15s Windows
  x64, 3m37s Linux arm64, 3m16s Linux x64, and 2m41s macOS arm64. Arm64 builds took 141,484 ms
  and 116,582 ms; smoke took 5,784 ms and 5,439 ms at 53,014,528 and 53,047,296 bytes RSS. The
  complete smoke stages took 7,448 ms and 7,383 ms. Build peak RSS, open files/channels, and
  cancellation settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/jobs and the five unpublished artifacts above; rejected arm64 bytes
  remained runner-local
- Oracle proved: adding the reviewed compiler/linker settings did not alter the arm64 failure
  signature, while all five controls and both arm64 runtime executions remain healthy. The strict
  comparator and no-upload boundary still work. This falsifies the hypothesis that the copied
  settings alone are sufficient.
- Does not prove: whether the generated MSBuild project actually propagates both settings to every
  `conpty_console_list` compile/link invocation, what the repeated ARM64 instruction represents, a
  safe producer correction, arm64 or cross-run equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH,
  publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native negative evidence and five reproducible control cells only; no
  tuple or production checkbox.
- Follow-up: inspect the generated `conpty_console_list.vcxproj` fail-closed for the expected
  compiler/linker inputs and emit bounded paired ARM64 instruction/disassembly context around the
  first differing ranges. Do not change the producer, normalize binaries, weaken comparison, or
  upload rejected bytes before that evidence.

- Green result: PASS. All syntax checks exited zero; the purpose command passed 8/8 tests across
  three suites; all 15 artifact suites passed 53/53 tests. Typecheck, focused oxlint, the
  355-entry max-lines ratchet, full repository lint/reliability/localization, formatting, staged
  hooks, and diff checks exited zero. Full lint emitted only pre-existing warnings outside this
  package.
- Duration and resource metrics: purpose suite 156 ms Vitest; complete artifact suite 1.11s
  Vitest. Static-gate wall time, synthetic peak RSS, open files/channels, and cancellation
  settlement were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact source commit and local command output; no binary artifact was
  created or uploaded
- Oracle proved: Windows artifact builds now reject a missing, duplicate, non-inherited, or
  wrong-architecture Release `ClCompile`/`Link` option in the generated
  `conpty_console_list.vcxproj` before runtime staging, and log the exact accepted setting summary.
  On an arm64 mismatch the workflow retains the existing structured PE diagnostic, then requests
  only absolute image addresses `0x180001000` through `0x180001200` from native
  `llvm-objdump.exe` before the fatal throw. Rejected bytes still cannot reach artifact staging.
- Does not prove: the real generated XML shape, native `llvm-objdump` availability/output, which
  repeated ARM64 instruction differs, a safe producer correction, arm64 equality, oldest
  baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: local generated-project and bounded-disassembly contracts only; no
  tuple or production checkbox.
- Follow-up: push the exact implementation and ledger head, run all six target-native cells, and
  require both Windows jobs to prove generated settings. If arm64 still differs, record the two
  bounded disassemblies and retain strict failure/no-upload before any producer correction.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-MSBUILD-PLATFORM-CASE-CI-RED-001 — Native arm64 Release-group lookup fails closed

  `87168238954`
- Runners: the six target-native labels recorded in prior reproducibility evidence. The failing cell
  was GitHub-hosted `windows-11-arm`, image `win11-arm64` release `20260706.102`, native `ARM64`,
  runner 2.335.1, Node v24.18.0, MSVC tools 14.44.35207, Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0, and an arm64
  developer environment exposing `Platform=arm64`.
- Remote and transport: none; target-native artifact assembly, generated-project verification, and
  unpublished Actions artifact upload only
- Exact evidence commands:

  ```sh
  gh run view 29357355064 --repo stablyai/orca \

  gh api repos/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29357355064/artifacts --paginate
  ```

- Result: FAIL as the intended strict evidence gate. Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows
  x64 built twice, inspected, executed, compared exactly, and uploaded. Windows x64 logged the
  required `/Brepro` and `/experimental:deterministic` compiler and linker settings for both clean
  builds. Native Windows arm64 completed compilation of the first copied node-pty tree, then the
  generated-project verifier rejected it with `generated MSBuild settings lack one exact Release
configuration` before runtime staging, verification, smoke, comparison, or diagnostics. Its
  artifact upload was skipped.
- Uploaded controls: Linux x64 artifact `8320756625` (29,278,781 bytes,
  `sha256:50bab609edc8e4eb776f462622c5e1310e926049e5ec0e759692ea4ae74142a4`), Linux arm64

  `sha256:a325d8e09c0391ee971328da397ac23412024ce2e4bf0dc633f897f8b923add2`). The run contains
  exactly five unpublished seven-day artifacts and no Windows arm64 artifact.
- Duration and resource metrics: jobs were 6m43s macOS x64, 6m24s Windows arm64, 5m15s Windows
  x64, 3m24s Linux x64, 3m23s Linux arm64, and 3m16s macOS arm64. The arm64 verifier failure
  occurred 2m24s into the build/inspect step before runtime smoke, so no new arm64 smoke RSS,
  channel/file count, cancellation, or fallback metric exists for this run.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/jobs and the five unpublished artifacts above; no rejected arm64
  runtime or binary was staged or uploaded
- Oracle proved: the generated-setting verifier executes after native compilation and fails closed
  before staging when its Release-group architecture spelling does not match. Windows x64 proves
  both required settings in both generated projects. The native arm64 developer environment uses a
  lowercase platform spelling, while all five architecture controls and the no-upload boundary
  remain intact.
- Does not prove: the exact native arm64 generated XML condition, that a case-insensitive exact
  architecture match reaches its option blocks, a complete arm64 runtime, paired disassembly, a
  safe producer correction, arm64 equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication,
  transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native negative verifier evidence and five reproducible control cells
  only; no tuple or production checkbox.
- Follow-up: cover lowercase `arm64` with a purpose fixture and compare only the expected Release
  architecture case-insensitively, retaining exact group and option cardinality. Rerun both Windows
  cells and all four POSIX controls before interpreting the underlying PE drift.

- Result: FAIL as the intended strict reproducibility gate. The lowercase `arm64` correction reaches
  the one expected Release group on both native arm64 clean builds. Both log exactly one inherited
  compiler and linker option block containing `/Brepro` and `/experimental:deterministic`, then
  assemble, inspect, verify, and execute the complete runtime. Each bundled Node v24.18.0 smoke
  proves ABI 137, patched PTY input/resize/exit code 23, watcher create/update/delete, and settled
  Windows resources. Strict comparison then rejects only
  `runtime/node_modules/node-pty/build/Release/conpty_console_list.node`; no arm64 output is staged
  for upload.
- Windows arm64 outputs: both PE files are 956,928 bytes. The first content identity is
  `sha256:a6adc716ec39503f68f4e322624ed9193b9343ca4b5f74d22843c47635e81519`, with
  33,261,547-byte ZIP
  `sha256:5aebde73ef6cad605d13c5c27977f1229729aa28a6959649989d8ecd4a6d2a9e`; the second is
  `sha256:2aef13722dd084941069d260591c529d1ca5ebf0b1e2defa34da4c43f44c2d24`, with the same

  contain 42 files and expand to 86,189,895 bytes.
- PE oracle: the complete scan reports 5,826 differing bytes across 2,886 coalesced ranges. The
  `.text` contribution is 5,758 bytes across 2,879 two-byte ranges from file offsets 1,052 through
  47,102, exactly 16 bytes apart. The remaining 68 bytes are one four-byte COFF timestamp, three
  four-byte debug timestamps, one 16-byte CodeView identifier, and 36 derived `.rdata` bytes.
  Section layout, file size, executable control-flow bytes, and all other bytes match.
- Paired disassembly oracle: the first 512 `.text` bytes contain repeated 16-byte function thunks.
  For every displayed thunk, `adrp x16, target`, `add x16, x16, offset`, and `br x16` are
  byte-identical. Only the unreachable fourth instruction differs: first build `0000024d`
  (`udf #0x24d`), second build `0000016d` (`udf #0x16d`). This classifies the changing bytes as
  linker-emitted thunk padding; it does not yet prove the generated linker setting responsible.

  SSH channel/file counts, and fallback delay are outside this artifact-only run.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/jobs and the five unpublished artifacts above; rejected arm64 bytes
  exist only in the bounded job workspace and log diagnostics and were not uploaded
- Oracle proved: real native lowercase platform acceptance, exact generated compiler/linker option
  propagation, two complete executable arm64 candidates, strict rejection, exact five-control
  reproducibility, bounded linker-thunk classification, and rejected-output no-upload.
- Does not prove: whether MSBuild enabled incremental linking, that disabling it is the safe producer
  correction, arm64 equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback,
  UI, or any enabled tuple. No executable byte may be normalized from this evidence.
- Checklist items satisfied: target-native platform-case gate and bounded ARM64 instruction
  diagnostic only; no tuple or production checkbox.
- Follow-up: add a purpose-tested bounded parser for the exact generated Release
  `LinkIncremental` state, require both Windows clean builds to report it, and rerun all six native
  controls before considering one copied-artifact producer correction.

- Green result: PASS. All syntax checks exited zero; the purpose command passed 9/9 tests across
  three suites; all 15 artifact suites passed 54/54 tests. Typecheck, focused oxlint, the 355-entry
  max-lines ratchet, full repository lint/reliability/localization, formatting, staged hooks, and
  diff checks exited zero. Full lint emitted only pre-existing warnings outside this package;
  `lint-staged` reported no staged files in its standalone run and the commit hook subsequently ran
  oxlint, React Doctor, and oxfmt successfully over all four staged files.
- Duration and resource metrics: purpose gate 1.93 s wall / 459 ms Vitest; complete artifact gate
  2.87 s wall / 1.35 s Vitest; typecheck 3.10 s; focused lint and line ratchet 3.09 s; full lint
  12.91 s. Synthetic peak RSS, open files/channels, cancellation settlement, and fallback delay
  were not instrumented.
- Artifact/log/trace link: exact implementation commit and local command output; no binary artifact
  was created or uploaded
- Oracle proved: Windows builds form a bounded `MSBuild.exe` query for the exact generated
  `conpty_console_list.vcxproj`, Release configuration, and tuple architecture; request only the
  evaluated `LinkIncremental` property; accept exactly one case-insensitive boolean result; and
  fail before staging on missing, noisy, or non-boolean output. x64 and arm64 commands are covered,
  POSIX creates no query, and the result is appended to the existing generated-setting record.
- Does not prove: `MSBuild.exe -getProperty` availability or result on either native Windows image,
  the actual effective incremental-link state, the thunk owner, a safe producer correction, arm64
  equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled
  tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: local bounded effective-link-state diagnostic only; no tuple or
  production checkbox.
- Follow-up: push the exact implementation and ledger head, run all six target-native cells, and
  require both Windows clean builds to report `linkIncremental` before changing the producer.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-LINK-INCREMENTAL-CI-RED-001 — Native property oracle is empty and fails closed

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: exact head `2d4433bbd0d2481d3f91c56d10155989cd6e7e44`, containing exact
  diagnostic implementation commit `36a19f525cc63e488f49daa5c3a6aafc590acc08`; stacked draft
  PR [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741)
- Run and jobs: [run 29359948742](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29359948742),
  conclusion `failure`; macOS x64 `87177167723` success, Linux x64 `87177167732` success, Windows
  x64 `87177167740` expected diagnostic failure, Windows arm64 `87177167757` expected diagnostic
  failure, macOS arm64 `87177167776` success, and Linux arm64 `87177167801` success
- Runners: GitHub-hosted Windows x64 used `windows-2022` / `win22` `20260706.237.1`, native X64;
  Windows arm64 used `windows-11-arm` / `win11-arm64` `20260706.102.1`, native ARM64. Both recorded
  Node v24.18.0 and exact source head `2d4433bbd`. The four POSIX cells used the same target-native
  labels as E-M3-WINDOWS-ARM64-THUNK-DISASSEMBLY-CI-RED-001.
- Remote and transport: none; target-native artifact assembly, strict pre-staging diagnostic, and
  unpublished Actions artifacts only
- Exact evidence commands:

  ```sh
  gh run view 29359948742 --repo stablyai/orca \
    --json headSha,status,conclusion,url,createdAt,updatedAt,jobs
  gh api repos/stablyai/orca/actions/jobs/87177167740/logs

  gh api 'repos/stablyai/orca/actions/runs/29359948742/artifacts?per_page=100'
  ```

- Result: FAIL as the intended diagnostic boundary. Each native Windows job completes the first
  copied node-pty build and validates the generated Release compiler/linker option blocks. The
  subsequent `MSBuild.exe -getProperty:LinkIncremental` query exits zero but writes only an empty
  value. The strict parser rejects it with `unexpected LinkIncremental evaluation from MSBuild`
  before runtime staging, archive creation, verification, smoke, comparison, or upload. This
  proves the property oracle is not usable and does not prove that incremental linking is enabled
  or disabled.
- Uploaded controls: exactly four unpublished seven-day POSIX artifacts and no Windows artifacts:
  Linux x64 `8321792649`, 29,280,250 bytes,
  `sha256:81b21c5f0670cd0337a9b8c666a154c474f52780d19d745497e25bbe69adcfe3`; Linux arm64

  `sha256:deca7d86e20442287878c6d17f6d533ba6be626dd7ff765f7cd841986272ffc8`; macOS x64

  `8321811571`, 24,727,700 bytes,
  `sha256:8fc66890341f548671ec15d0875186ca5ea128cb1ea959a2a69cacc14b9c0864`.
- Duration and resource metrics: jobs ran 9m08s macOS x64, 3m13s Linux x64, 2m50s Windows x64,
  6m31s Windows arm64, 3m56s macOS arm64, and 3m21s Linux arm64. Both Windows failures occur after
  one native build but before runtime smoke, so no new Windows RSS, channel/file count,
  cancellation, or fallback metric exists.
- Artifact/log/trace link: run/jobs and the four unpublished POSIX artifacts above; no Windows
  runtime or binary was staged or uploaded
- Oracle proved: both native Windows architectures return an empty evaluated Release
  `LinkIncremental` property and the bounded diagnostic rejects it before staging. All four POSIX
  controls remain reproducible and upload.
- Does not prove: the actual linker command, whether `/INCREMENTAL` was passed, the thunk owner, a
  safe producer correction, Windows runtime equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH,
  publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: native negative property-oracle evidence only; no tuple or production
  checkbox.
- Follow-up: inspect the actual post-build `link.command.1.tlog` under a byte cap, emit only an
  allowlisted switch summary, and retain all existing strict comparison/no-upload controls.

### E-M3-WINDOWS-LINK-COMMAND-TRACKING-LOCAL-001 — Bounded native linker-command gate

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Commit SHA / PR: exact implementation commit
  `4a66435b71b158624645c614543d139a9ea45d51`; stacked draft
  PR [#8741](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/pull/8741), target-native execution pending
- Runner: macOS 26.2 build 25C56, native Apple M4 arm64; Node v26.0.0 and pnpm 10.24.0. This runner
  cannot generate the native MSBuild tracking file, so Windows x64/arm64 jobs remain authoritative.
- Remote and transport: none; bounded local file/parser and builder-ordering contracts only
- Exact red commands:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-pty-windows-build-determinism.test.mjs
  /usr/bin/time -lp pnpm exec vitest run --config config/vitest.config.ts \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-pty-windows-build-determinism.test.mjs \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-node-pty-build.test.mjs \
    config/scripts/ssh-relay-runtime-workflow.test.mjs
  ```

- Red result: the pre-implementation purpose suite failed two and passed four tests because the
  tracking-path/parser contracts did not exist. The later bounded-reader audit deliberately added
  malformed UTF-16 input and failed one of eleven tests because `Buffer.toString('utf16le')`
  preserved a lone surrogate instead of rejecting it. Fatal `TextDecoder` decoding closed that
  gap; the audit red run took 0.99 s wall with 131,973,120-byte maximum RSS and
  96,196,032-byte peak memory footprint.
- Exact green commands:

- Green result: PASS. The purpose suites pass 11/11 tests and all 15 artifact suites pass 56/56.
  Syntax checks, typecheck, focused oxlint, the 355-entry max-lines ratchet, full repository
  lint/reliability/localization, formatting, and diff checks exit zero. Full lint emits only
  pre-existing warnings outside this artifact package.
- Duration and resource metrics: purpose gate 0.89 s wall / 166 ms Vitest with 132,513,792-byte
  maximum RSS and 96,720,296-byte peak footprint; complete artifact gate 1.35 s wall / 550 ms Vitest
  with 137,068,544-byte maximum RSS and 95,819,104-byte peak footprint; typecheck 3.10 s, focused
  lint 0.34 s, max-lines 2.01 s, full lint 10.89 s, and format 2.24 s. No SSH channels/files,
  cancellation, fallback, or runtime latency is exercised by this diagnostic-only package.
- Artifact/log/trace link: current exact source/tests and local command output; no runtime artifact
  was created, staged, published, or uploaded
- Oracle proved: the builder locates the target-specific post-build
  `conpty_console_list.tlog/link.command.1.tlog`, reads at most 256 KiB plus one rejection byte,
  accepts fatal UTF-16LE-BOM or UTF-8 decoding, requires exactly one command record and one each of
  `/Brepro`, `/guard:cf`, and `/experimental:deterministic`, classifies incremental linking as
  enabled/disabled/unspecified, and emits only the allowlisted switch summary. Oversize, malformed
  encoding/switches, duplicate records/switches, ambiguous incremental states, and missing required
  switches fail before runtime staging. POSIX paths create no tracking-file lookup.
- Does not prove: the file path/encoding/record shape on either native Windows runner, the emitted
  switch summary, the incremental-link state, thunk ownership, a safe producer correction, arm64
  equality, oldest baselines, native trust, SSH, publication, transfer, fallback, UI, or any enabled
  tuple.
- Checklist items satisfied: local bounded post-build tracking diagnostic only; no tuple or
  production checkbox.
- Follow-up: push the exact implementation and ledger head, run all six target-native cells, and
  require both Windows clean builds to emit the same accepted summary before changing the producer.

## Accepted Gaps

No product gap is accepted merely because it appears in this list. Each entry requires explicit

## Final Definition of Done

The project is not complete until every applicable item below is checked with evidence IDs.

- [ ] Milestone 0 legacy safety net is merged and live-proven.
- [ ] All Milestone 1 decisions are closed and reviewed.
- [ ] Artifact/manifest schema and full-runtime identity are implemented and hostile-input tested.
- [ ] Every enabled runtime tuple passes build, native, oldest-baseline, trust, and live SSH proofs.
- [ ] Relay artifacts are immutable prerequisites of every desktop build.
- [ ] Target-native builds, native signing jobs, and the fail-closed aggregate/manifest job pass all
      failure and recovered-draft rehearsals before desktop packaging.
- [ ] Every packaged desktop embeds the exact signed manifest whose bytes are published.
- [ ] Client download/cache/extraction passes online, offline, proxy, integrity, concurrency, and
      resource-failure gates.
- [ ] Every SSH transfer path is bounded, cancellable, no-tar-capable, mode-correct, and full-size
      tested.
- [ ] Remote installation uses full-tree verification and a structured, mode-qualified completion
      record.
- [ ] Declared POSIX/Windows bootstrap primitives, missing-command behavior, BusyBox variants, and
      no-remote-hash-tool behavior are live-proven.
- [ ] The primary path launches with bundled Node and performs no remote npm or HTTP operation.
- [ ] Fallback aborts and joins bundled work, uses separate state, and is race/failure tested.
- [ ] Every integrity/security failure fails closed in `auto` without automatic legacy.
- [ ] The exact online/offline/cache matrix is live-proven.
- [ ] Every relay RPC family, reconnect, reattach, upgrade, downgrade, concurrent-client, and GC
      contract passes through the packaged runtime.
- [ ] Security review, SBOM, provenance, key lifecycle, native signing, CVE ownership, and emergency
      refresh through a new desktop build/embedded manifest are operational; old clients stay pinned.
- [ ] Numeric performance and resource budgets pass on the required matrix.
- [ ] Draft release read-back and public direct-URL behavior pass for exact stable/RC/perf tags.
- [ ] Three consecutive qualifying RCs pass without unexplained fallback or relay regression.
- [ ] Stable soak and rollback criteria pass.
- [ ] Every accepted gap is closed or explicitly retained with owner, fallback, and promotion rule.
- [ ] HTML plan, this checklist, reliability-gate metadata, troubleshooting docs, and PR evidence are
      current.
- [ ] Legacy fallback remains unless a separate reviewed decision authorizes narrowing/removal.

## Next Required Action

Push exact implementation commit `4a66435b7` plus its evidence-ledger head, then rerun both Windows
architectures and all four POSIX controls at the exact head. Require both Windows clean builds to
report the same allowlisted switch summary. Only if that target-native evidence classifies the
2,879 function thunks may one copied-artifact producer correction be considered; retain strict
comparison and rejected-output no-upload.
Cross-family Layer B targets, the protected manifest-signing environment,
oldest-baseline/native-trust cells, and the paired legacy performance baseline remain
release/default-path blockers; no publication, desktop resolver, SSH transfer/install, per-target
Beta, fallback, tuple enablement, or default behavior may be connected by this package.
